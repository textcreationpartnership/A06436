         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the doctrine of the holie fathers, that there be three thinges verie neceſſarie and of ineſtimable importaunce to the iuſt man to preſerue him in his iuſtice: to witt Praier, Readinge, and doinge of good workes. In theſe three thinges ought the iuſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe himſelfe euerie daye, and deuide his tyme ſo diſcreetelie, and ſo like a good Chriſtian, that he be euer founde occupied in ſome of them. Prayer illuminateth, purgeth, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, reioyceth, obteyneth feruour, cauſeth all traueile to ſeeme ſweete, and lighte, breedeth deuotion, engendereth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence, (in caſe our owne ſpirite doe not reproue vs:) Prayer ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth awaie ſlouthe, frayeth the ennemie,
<pb facs="tcp:872:12"/>and ouercometh temptation. And therefore a certaine wiſe man ſaide: <hi>Non te pigeat orare, ſi vis à vitiis liberari. Be not ſlacke to praye, if thou wilt be deliuered from vices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Prayer is verie neceſſarie towardes the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyninge of the grace of God, without which the ſpirituall life will vtterlie decaye, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe. And therefore prayer is preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore readinge. Tertullian ſpeakinge of prayer ſaithe. That thinge is alwaies to be vſed, which is alwaies good: And he addeth furthermore, and ſaieth: If prayer be neceſſarie in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and at all tymes,<note place="margin">Continencie neceſſarie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prayer.</note> then is continencie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie alſo vnto prayer: for ſo much as praier procedeth of continencie, wherefore if thy continencie hath cauſe to be aſhamed, then ſhall thy prayer likewiſe be aſhamed. The ſpirite carryeth our prayer vnto God: and if the ſpirit finde it ſelf faultie, then our prayer aſcendeth with ſhame vnto him. Againe, Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiodorus ſaieth, that perſeuerance in prayer auaileth much to obteine firmnes of harte. By meanes of continuall prayer the deuills and their deceytfull ſnares are ouercome, and by the ſame the iuſt man weakeneth their forces, and vexations. By meanes of prayer he maketh them become weake, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and eaſie to be conquered: and by the ſame he maketh himſelfe alſo become ſtronge and a conquerour ouer them. If thou praye with perſeuerance thou ſhalt obteyne ſweeteneſſe, and withall a more feruent deſire

            <p>Theſe three pointes nowe good Chriſtian Reader, which ſerue (as we haue declared) to preſerue the righteous man in his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, are ſo well taught, and ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie ſet forth in theſe notable bookes of the Reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d religious Learned Father, F.

<pb facs="tcp:872:15"/>de GRANADA, that he muſt needes be verie harde harted, who readinge them with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, deuotion, and with a Chriſtian deſire to take profite by them, doth not merueil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlie inriche him ſelfe with theſe three trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: to witte, with prayer, readinge, and doeinge of good workes. Wherefore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is deſirous to profite in theſe three thinges, hath here verie Catholike, ſounde, and profitable doctrine, and in all pointes agreable with the vniuerſall doctrine of the holie auncient Fathers, and of the diuine Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. In theſe ſingular deuout holie boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes he ſhall not finde any thinge that may either offend him, or bringe him into any errour, or ſcruple. Here ſhall he finde manie thinges that may edifie, delighte, teache, and prouoke him to the loue of God, and withall to the abhorringe of ſinne, and contempte of the worlde. From receauinge which fruites no man is here excluded: for ſo much as the Awthor hath with a rare wiſedome in ſuch wiſe tempered the doctrine, and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated him ſelfe vnto all ſtates, and conditions of perſons, that neither the verie highe and learned haue anie cauſe to leaue it, as ouer baſe for them: nor the verie lowe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned to refuſe it, as ouer highe for their capacities. For here is made a conuenient prouiſion of competent meates both for the one ſort, and for the other. And becauſe the
<pb facs="tcp:872:16"/>Awthor vnderſtode right well howe farre the mouthes of men now adayes are owt of taſt, and how much they are more affectionate vnto the ſleſhe pottes of Egypt, than to the breade of Angels, I meane hereby, rather to the readinge of prophane bookes, by reaſon of the pleaſant ſtile wherewith they thinke they are written, than to the bookes of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall doctrine, which are commonly written with more ſimplicitie, he hath therefore dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this meate in ſuche wiſe, and hath written this doctrine in ſuch a ſweete and pleaſant ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, that it maie prouoke an appetite vnto this boke, euen in ſuch perſons as doe otherwiſe lothe good and holeſome foode: beſides, that the verie matters them ſelues are exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well choſen, and of great profite. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it were the parte of rude and ruſticall perſons to geue thankes to the bees that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke the honie combes, and not vnto almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God who created the flowers from when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce the bees gather the honie, which they worke in their hiues: I exhort all perſons to geue thankes to the deuoute and Learned Author of theſe workes, for theſe ſo ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te and ſauorie honie combes which he hath here geuen vs, in ſuch ſorte that they omit not to procede further, and to geue thankes to almightie God alſo, who hath ſent the flowers wherewith this honie is made. And withall I make humble requeſt vnto all men,

And in this ſence we do now vſe this vorde becaus the principal matter of this booke, is of meditation, and conſideration of thinges apperteyning to almightie God, and of the principall miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Catholike faith.</p>
            <p>The verie thinge that moued me to treat of this matter was, for that I vnderſtode,<note place="margin">The want of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of all the euilles in the world. <hi>Ieremie</hi> 12.</note> that one of the principall cawſes of all the euilles, that be in the world, is the want of conſideration: According as the Prophett Ieremie ſignified when he ſaid. <hi>All the earth is deſtroied with deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, becawſe there is none that thinketh with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention vpon the thinges apperteyning vnto God.</hi> whereby it appeareth, that the verie cawſe or
<pb facs="tcp:872:20"/>our euills is not ſomuch the want of faith, as the want of due conſideration of the miſteries of our faith. For trewlie if there were no want in this behalfe the miſteries of our faithe be of ſo great vertue,<note place="margin">The conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our fayth is a greate bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to with hold vs from ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</note> and efficacie, that if the verie leaſt miſterie of them, were conſidered with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and deuotion, euen the ſame would be a great brydle and redreſſe of our liffe. For who would euer goe about to committ anie ſinne, if he conſidered that almightie God died for ſinne? and that he punyſhethe ſinne, with perpetuall banniſhement out of the kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of heauen, and with euerlaſting paines and tormentes in the horrible fyer of hell?</p>
            <p>Whereby ye maie ſee, that although the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of our faith, be of verie great force, to encline our hartes vnto goodnes: yet becauſe there be verie manie Chriſtians that haue no due conſideration of the thinges they beleue, therefore they worke not ſuch effecte in there hartes, as ſuch miſteries being well weied and conſidered were able to worke. For like as the phiſitions affirme that if we will haue a mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to helpe a ſicke man, it is neceſſarie, it be firſt wrowght and digeſted in the ſtomak with naturall heat, (becauſe otherwiſe it ſhall not be anie profitt to him at all:) euen ſo alſo, if we will haue the miſteries of our faith to be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and healthfull vnto our ſoules, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite they be firſt wrought, and digeſted in our hartes with the heate of deuotion and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation: becauſe otherwiſe they ſhall profit vs
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:872:20"/>verie littell. And for want hereof, we ſee that manie Chriſtians, which are verie whole and ſownd in matters of faith, be yet in there liues verie licentious and diſſolute.<note place="margin">The cawſe whie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianes, that are ſounde in matters of faythe; be yet verie diſſolute in theire li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues.</note> And the reaſon is, becauſe they do not conſider, and weigh the holie miſteries which they beleue: and ſo they keepe there faith, as it were faſt locked in a corner of a cheſt, or as a ſword in the ſcabar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, or as a medecine in the potticaries ſhoppe, and vſe not the benefitt thereof, for ſuch purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as it ſerueth. They beleue generallie, and as it were in a fardel or groſſe ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me, all ſuch thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as the Catholike Church beleueth. They beleue that there ſhalbe a iudgment, that there ſhalbe paines for the wicked, and glorie for the good:<note place="margin">Verye few Chriſtians doe ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the miſteries of our faithe.</note> but how manie Chriſtians ſhall ye finde, that do conſider after what ſort this iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gment, theſe paines, and this glorie ſhalbe, with other the like circumſtances?</p>
            <p>Now this is the cawſe, why the holie ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſo earneſtlie commendeth vnto vs, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall conſideration, and meditation of the lawe of God, and of the miſteries thereof: which is indeede the ſtudie of true wiſedome.

            <p>By this therefore we ſee plainlie, what great neede we haue of this holie exerciſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentlie how blyndelie and fowlie they are deceaued, that either deſpiſe or make little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of the holie exerciſe of praier, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: not conſidering that this is openlie to gayneſaie and contemne that thing, which the holie Ghoſt hath with ſo great inſtancie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended vnto vs. I wiſhe that ſuch perſons would reade thoſe fiue bookes of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration, which S.

            <p>The firſt part, for remedie of the firſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience, treateth of the matter of praier,<note place="margin">The firſte parte of this boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke.</note> or meditation: wherein are conteined fowertience meditations, ſeruing for all the ſeuen daies of the weike, both in the morninge and euening. And theſe meditations do conteine the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall places and miſteries of our faith, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the conſideration of thoſe miſteries, that are of moſt force, and power, to brydle our har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and to incline them to the loue, and feare of God, and to the abhorring of ſinne. In like maner there are ſett out, the fiue partes of this exerciſe, which be Preparation: readinge: me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation: thankes geuing: and petition: which is done to this end, that a man maie haue great varietie of matters, wherein to occupie his hart:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:872:22"/>wherewith to procure and ſtirre vp the taſt of deuotion, and withall wherewith to illuminat and inſtruct his vnderſtanding, with diuers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, and inſtructions. Beſides this, there is alſo treated therein, of ſix kindes of thinges that are to be conſidered in euerie one of the pointes of the Paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Sauiour: that both they, and all the reſt, maie miniſter vnto vs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re plentifull matter for meditation. Theſe three thinges are ſett forthe in the firſt part of this worcke, for remedie of the firſt inconuenience.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The thirde parte of this boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke.</note> After theſe I haue added the third parte, in which is treated of the vertue of praier, and of her two companions, faſting, and almes deedes: to the intent, that when a man ſeeth, that in all the booke there is treated of praier, and of the paines he ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ht to take for the ſame: he maie vnderſtand, how well his labour is employed, which is beſtowed in obteining of a thinge, of ſo great and wonderfull profitt.</p>
            <p>Peraduenture the Chriſtian reader wilbe offended with the length of the meditations,
<pb facs="tcp:872:23"/>which we haue here ſett fourth for the ſeuen daies of the weike. Howbeit for this I haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie anſweres. The firſt is, conſidering that in theſe meditations, is treated of the principall places, and miſteries of our faith, (the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof is of ſo great importance, for the due orderinge and reforming of our liffe) it behoueth me therefore to enlarge my ſtyle (in theſe matters eſpetiallie) by reaſon of the great fruit, and commodetie that maie enſue vnto vs by the ſame. For in this booke our meaning is, not onelie to geue matter of meditation, but much more to ſhowe the ende of meditation, which is the feare of God, and amendment of our liffe.<note place="margin">The ende of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the feare of God, and amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of our life.</note> For the procuring whereof, one of the thinges that moſt helpeth vs, is the profound and long conſideration of the miſteries, that are treated in theſe meditations. For certeinlie theſe fourtene meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, be as it were ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſermons, in which is laide, as it were a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein batterie to mans hart, to cawſe it to yeald, (ſo much as is poſſible) and to ſurrender it ſelfe vp into the handes of his rightefull and true ſouereine Lorde.</p>
            <p>This was the cheifeſt cauſe that moued me to make the meditations ſo longe. Beſides this, I ſee not, why the gheſt that is inuited, ſhould complaine that the table is to full furniſhed with manie diſhes, ſith we bynd him not (as by waie of conſtraint) to make an ende of them all, but onely emonge ſo manie ſundrie thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to make his choice of that, which ſerueth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:872:23"/>beſt for his purpoſe. Moreouer (that there might be the leſſe occaſion of complaint) I haue putt the ſomme of each meditation at the beginninge thereof, to the intent that ſuch as minde not to paſſe anie further, might there haue ſuch thinges breiflie abridged, as be neceſſarie for the time, they intend to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe in this holie exerciſe.</p>

Fayth is that which teacheth vs,<note place="margin">Fayth bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlethe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s harte, and cauſeth him to liue in the feare of God.</note> that there is an other lyfe after this; and that there ſhalbe a generall iudgement of all our workes: and that we ſhall receiue either euerlaſtinge glorie for the good, or els euerlaſtinge paine for the euill.

And therefore the Prophet ſaied: <hi>That the iuſt man liueth by fayth:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. <hi>1.</hi> Heb. <hi>10.</hi> Galat. <hi>3.</hi> Abac, <hi>2.4.</hi>

                     </note> And this is the cauſe why the Apoſtel wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs to take faythe as a ſheild againſt all

                  <p>Wherefore that this fayth maye worke this effect in vs, it is verie requiſite that we doe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metimes ponder and conſider in our myndes with good attention and deuotion ſuch thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as our fayth teacheth vs.<note place="margin">Vnleſſe we po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dre and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the myſteries of our fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, our faythe is as it were a lett<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we haue not opened the letter, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered what thinges are conteined in it. Now what thinge coulde be ſaid more aptlie, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to the purpoſe, towchinge the fayth of the wicked and diſſolute Chriſtians? For ſuerlie there can not be thinges of greater terrour, and ioye, than thoſe are which our fayth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth vnto vs. But the wicked Chriſtians becauſe they doe neuer open this letter, to ſee what thinges be conteined in it, (I meane he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby, becauſe they doe neuer thinke and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate vpon theſe miſteries of our Chriſtian faythe, or if they thinke vpon them, they paſſe them ouer verie lightlie, and in great haſt,) they cauſe not in them this manner of motion, and alteration, to witt, of ioye, or of feare.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:872:27"/>Wherefore it behoueth vs ſometimes to open this letter of our faythe, I meane, the myſteries thereof, and to reade the ſame very leiſurlie, and to conſider with good attention, what thinges are tawght vs in the ſame, the which is done by meanes of the exerciſe of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>This neceſſitie of conſideration maie be proued by an other reaſon alſo. For we ſee by experience in all habilities, and graces, both
<pb facs="tcp:872:33"/>ſuch as are naturall,<note place="margin">All vertues maie be loſt by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and wante of vſe and exerciſe of them.</note> as thoſe alſo that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, (I meane, gotten by our owne traueile and induſtrie,) that like as they increaſe by vſe, and exerciſe, euen ſo are they alſo forgotten if we leaue to exerciſe them. And this we ſee playnelie verified euen in ſuch thinges as be verie naturall and cuſtomably vſed. For what thinge is more vſuall than the tonge, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which a man is enured and acquainted withall euen from his mothers pappes, and yet maie it be forgotten in time, if it be not vſed, and exerciſed. But what ſpeake I of the tonge, ſeinge it happeneth ſometimes, that when a man hath lyen ſicke in his bed, but onely foure or fiue monethes, he can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afterwardes frame him ſelfe to goe againe when he ryſeth, notwithſtandinge that goinge is a thinge ſo naturall and ſo cuſtomably vſed. Now if the habilities which be ſo naturall and ſo much exerciſed doe ſo much decaye when they be not vſed: what will the ſupernaturall habilities doe, which are but as it were certain proppes and ſtaies adioyned vnto vs,<note place="margin">Charitie and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues will quicklie be loſt, vnleſſe we exerciſe our ſelues verie often in them.</note> to ſupplie the defectes of nature? And if charitie with all other vertues infuſed be in like maner to be reckened in this accompt, in what caſe then ſhall we be, if we doe but verie ſeldome or neuer exerciſe our ſelues in them? For if that thinge that is euen naturall will be loſt for wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of exerciſe, how much more will that be loſt that is ſupernaturall? And if that thinge maie be loſt that is faſt riueted euen in our verie

                  <p>Againe if it be true, that all amitie and fryndſhipe is both preſerued and increaſed by meanes of familiaritie and communication; and by the wante thereof is vtterlie quenched and loſt (according as Ariſtotle affirmeth) what ſhall then become of thoſe perſons, that haue no maner of communication with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God at all. And what can we hope of them, that do neuer ſpeake with him, nor he with them, nor ſo much as thinke, conſider, or treate of anie heauenlie matters?

For conſideration commonly is not occupied anie further but onely about enkendelinge of ſome one of theſe vertuouſe affections: but praier (when it is attent and deuout, and is withall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſpirite and feruencie of minde) is wonte to ſtirre vp all theiſe vertues aforeſaid. For when the ſoule preſenteth her ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore almightie God, with an earneſt greate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiere to appeaſe his wrath, and to deſiere him of mercie, then there is no ſtone ſo hard, but that it is moued hereunto. I meane hereby, that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is no holie affection, but that it is then wholie exerciſed and emploied to this purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:872:36"/>And it fareth in this caſe, as it doth with a mother that is deſirous to ſtill her childe, or as it doth with a good and louinge wife, that hath a deſire to pacefie her huſband, when ſhe perceaueth him to be angrie, In which caſes they are wont to omitt no meanes they can deuiſe, that maye aniewiſe further the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

All the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe thinges be performed in a deuout praier. And becauſe the habites of vertues do increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe with the exerciſe of their actes, hereof it procedethe, that the ſoule by meanes of this exerciſe of prayer remaynethe very much bewtified and perfited in theſe vertues. As <hi>S.

<pb facs="tcp:872:37"/>weakened is repaired: lukewarmenes is abandoned: the ruſtines of vices is conſumed: and in this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the liuelie ſparcles of heauenly deſires, do riſe vp, and ſhew them ſelues, emonge which burnethe the flame of the loue of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this we vnderſtand, that praier is a moſt conuenient exerciſe for that man, that min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to reforme his maners, and life, and to change himſelfe into an other man.

And that for this purpoſe, ſhe ſeeketh the whot aire of the ſowthe, that with the heate the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, her poores maie be opened, and with her mouing the olde fethers fall of, and ſo geue place to the newe that beginne to ſpringe out. But how much more wonderfull is it, to ſee a ſoule vnclothe her ſelfe of Adam and to put on Chriſt, to change the conditions of the olde man, and to adorne her ſelfe with the conditions of the new man? Now this change that is ſo wonderfull, is then wrought, when the deuoute ſoule turneth her ſelfe to the ſowthe, and there beateth her winges in the aire. And what is it to turne her ſelfe to the ſowthe: but to lift vp her ſpirite to the conſideration of the eternal light, and to the beames of the true ſonne of iuſtice? And what is it to beat her winges in the aire, but to be there ſighinge and pantinge with heauenly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and deſires, calling vpon almightie God, with great anguiſhe of minde, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiringe moſt humblie his fauore and grace? For then bloweth the aler of the ſowthe, that is the heauenly refreſhinge of the holie Ghoſt, who with his temperate heate, and ſweete mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge, ſtrengtheneth, and helpeth vs, to caſt

And this is that thinge, that Eccleſiaſticus ſignified by other wordes when he ſaid; <hi>They that feare our lord wil prepare their hartes,</hi>

                     <hi>and ſainctifie their ſowies before him.</hi> The which is principally do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in the exerciſe of deuoute praier.

If he be aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the cogitation of carnall pleaſure, and delite, he hydeth him ſelfe wholie in the holes of the rocke: that is: in the pretious woundes of our ſauiour Chriſt crucified.

Now ſeinge all theſe vertues be for the moſt parte vertues af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue, (as we haue alreadie declared) which affections muſt neceſſarily procede of ſome conſideration of the vnderſtandinge: if this conſideration be not exerciſed, how ſhall the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:872:42"/>vertues be preſerued? How ſhall a man hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe him ſelfe by faith, if he do not ſomety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes conſider ſuch thinges, as his faith telleth him? How ſhall he be enkendeled in charitie, and ſtrengthened in hope; how ſhall he brydel him ſelfe with the feare of God? How ſhall he be moued to deuotion, to ſorrowe for his ſinnes, and to the contempt of him ſelfe (wherein conſiſteth the vertue of humilitie, which apperteineth vnto all kinde of perſons) if he do not conſider thoſe thinges, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with theſe affections are wont to be inkende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, according as we haue before declared? Neither owght a man to paſſe ouer theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in the exerciſe of conſideration, with to much ſpeid, and in poſt haſt. For emonge the miſeries of mans hart, one of the greateſt is, that it is ſo ſenſible to vnderſtand the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the worlde, and ſo vnſenſible to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the thinges, apperteinyng vnto al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God. In ſo much that vnto the one, it is, as it were, a verie drie reede, and to th'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as it were, grene wood, that can not be ſet on fier, and enkendled, but with verie great labour, and trauell. And therefore we muſt not in our exerciſe of conſideration, paſſe ouer theſe thinges in ſuch haſt, but ſtaie, and pawſe for a tyme in them, more or leſſe, according as the holie Ghoſt ſhall inſtruct vs, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding alſo, as the buſines and occupations of euerie man in his ſtate, and vocation of life, ſhall geue him leaue. And it is not a matter
<pb facs="tcp:872:43"/>of mere neceſſitie to haue certein times ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed euerie daie for conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Vnto theſe thinges ye maie adde further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, the dangers of the world, with all the great difficulties, men haue to preſerue them ſelues without ſinne, in a bodie ſo euill diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and in a world ſo dangerous, and emon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge ſo manie ennemies, as we haue continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie aſſaulting vs on euerie ſide. And therefore (if for that thow art not a religious perſon) thy ſtate of life do not bynde the vnto ſo much exerciſe of praier and meditation, yet the greatnes of the danger and perrill, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thow liueſt in the worlde, muſt needes byn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de the to vſe ſome exerciſe therein.

For the religious perſon is protected, and garded, by his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, by incloſure within his monaſterie, by obſeruance of his rules, by obedience, by praiers, by faſtinges, by ſainge daylie diuine ſeruice, by the awſteritie of his order, by good companie, and religious conuerſation, and by all other ſpirituall exerciſes, and vertuous la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of the holie monaſticall life; in ſo much that euen the verie walles of their monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries be a great defence, and ſauegard vnto them, to keepe them from the occaſions and dangers of ſynne: but the laie perſon liuinge, practiſinge and dealinge daylie and howerlie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the thronge, and preſſe of the worlde, (beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des

Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore if the religious perſon owght to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies armed becauſe he is by his profeſſion a man of warre, euen ſo muſt the laie man be armed alſo in his maner, (althowgh not in ſo highe a degree) not becauſe the perfection of his ſtate of life, doth bynde him ſo much the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reunto, but by reaſon of the great perill and danger he lyueth in. For as well doe they goe armed, that haue ennemies, as thoſe that be

The which meanes although generally they be but of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unſell,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:872:46"/>yet ſometimes they maie be of precept, when the neceſſitie of exerciſinge them (as we haue ſaid) is ſo great, that without the vſe of thoſe meanes, the verie commaundementes them ſelues cannot be kepte, and fulfilled, as all the learned diuines do affirme. Howbeit euerie chriſtian that hath an earneſt deſier of his ſaluation, owght not to expecte, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laie the ſeekinge for theſe remedies, vntil the verie laſt, and extreme danger, when the kny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe is alreadie at his throte: but he owght to make good prouiſion, and to furniſhe him ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe before hand, by meanes of theſe for ſayd ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuall exerciſes, that he maie liue the more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, and ſecure, from the perill of breakinge Gods commaundementes.</p>
                  <p>Againe I confeſſe, that theſe meanes (as we haue ſaid) do apperteine to the religious, and to the laie people, after a diuers ſort: and that praier, and conſideration it ſelfe, which is one of theſe meanes, muſt be vſed of them in diuers degrees. For the religious perſon muſt exerciſe the ſame, as a thinge appertening to his office, and dewtie of his profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (becauſe he walketh towardes perfection) but the laie perſon, muſt exerciſe it, as a meane, whereby he maie the better fulfill his bounden duetie of keping the commaundementes of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God.

               <p>And it is to be noted, that the meditations that are here appoynted to be vſed at night, are firſt of all abridged into a briefe ſomme, wherein I haue ſet out in order the principall poyntes, that are to be conſidered in euerie one of them: (and afterwardes I haue added the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reunto, a more large and ample declaration of all the ſame poyntes.) And this ſummarie abridgement I made, to the intente, that after they haue bene red ouer diuers tymes, they maie be the better vnderſtode, and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon. True it is, that of the meditations vpon the holie paſſion, I haue not made the like abridgement at the beginninge of them, as I haue done of the others: becauſe I iudge, that the text of the holie Euangeliſtes, which I haue there ſet before, maie ſuffice for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And it is not needefull for vs at euerie ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me we go to meditation, to conſider all the principall poyntes, that are there particularlie
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:872:49"/>noted: but it ſhall ſuffiſe to take two, or three of them, moe, or leſſe, according as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, and tyme, that euerie one hath,<note place="margin">One my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie well conſidered and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated vpon, profiteth more, then manie ſlei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtelie paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ouer in haſte.</note>, ſhall require. For certeinlie there is more profit taken by one miſterie, or point, well thowght vpon, and dewlye conſidered: then by many that are ſleightelie paſſed ouer in haſt. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I thowght good, to note diuerſe and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie poyntes, to the intent, that emonge ſo great varietie of conſiderations, euerie one might make his choiſe of ſuch thinges, as might beſt ſerue his deuotion.</p>

                        <p>After this, conſider thoſe wordes, wherewith our ſauiour made an ende of this hiſtorie: ſain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge: <hi>I haue geueu you an example, that ye ſhoulde doe, euen as I haue done to you.</hi> which wordes are to be referred, not onelie to this matter, and example of humilitie, but euen alſo to all the other workes, and life of our ſauiour Chriſt. For ſo much as his whole life, is a moſt perfet pattern of all vertues, eſpetiallie of that vertu
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:872:56"/>which in this place is repreſented vnto vs,<note place="margin">The life of Chriſte is a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet patter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of all vertues and eſpeciallie of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> to witt humilitie, as the bleſſed martir Sainct Ciprian declareth more at large in theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. It was cheiflie (ſaith he) a worke of great patience, and humilitie, that ſo high and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a maieſtie woulde vouchſafe to come downe from heauen vnto the earth, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the himſelfe with our claie:<note place="margin">S.

The Lord would be baptiſed of his ſeruante: he that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to pardon ſinnes, would be waſſhed with the water of ſinners: he that feedeth all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, faſted fourtie daies in the wildernes, and in the end ſuffered honger, which he did to this end, that all ſuch as had a hongrie appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite after godes worde, and longed after his grace, might be ſatisfied and furniſhed with the ſame. he fowght with the diuell that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted him, and contentinge him ſelfe with the victorie, offered his ennemie no further har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, but by worde onelie. His diſciples he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer deſpiſed, as a Lord doth his ſeruantes: but enterteined them with great charitie, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuolence: yea he vſed them louingly as brethern. Neither is it to be merueyled at, that he thus behaued him ſelfe towardes his diſciples, being as they were obedient: ſeinge he could ſuffer that arrant traitor Iudas ſo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tienlie, and beare with him euen till the end,
<pb facs="tcp:872:57"/>and ſuffer him being his ennemie, to eate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him at his owne table, and kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winge full well, whereabowte he went, woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de neuer diſcouer him, but was content to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue a kiſſe of him, euen of him (I ſaie) that had ſoulde him with ſuch a traiterous peace.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, with what great patience did he beare with Iewes vntill that preſent how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re? how painfully did he labour to moue tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe vnbeleuinge hartes with his preachinge, to embrace the faith? what great trauaille tooke he, to allure thoſe vngratefull men vnto him, with good workes? how meekly anſwered he to ſuch as contraried him in his ſpeach? with what clemencie bare he with the prowde? with what a wounderfull humilitie yelded he to the furious rage of his ennemies, and perſecutors? How traueiled he euen vntill the verie howre of his moſt bitter paſſion, to recouer them, that had bene the murderers of the Prophetes, and heynous rebelles againſt almightie God. In li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke maner at the verie howre of his paſſion (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came to the ſheadinge of his moſt cruell death) how great were the opprobrious iniuries they offered vnto him? How patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlie gaue he them the hearinge thereof? How great were the mockes, and tauntes, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? How patientlie did he beare the vile ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge of thoſe infernall mouthes, that had him ſelfe, not longe before, with the ſpittell of his owne mowthe reſtored a blynd man to his

How ſuffered he their whippin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whoſe ſeruantes are wont in his name with mightie power to whippe the verie diuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les? how was he crowned with thornes, that crowneth his martirs with euerlaſtinge gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landes? How was he ſmitten on the face with the palmes of mens handes, that geueth the palme of victorie vnto ſuch as be conquerors? How was he ſpoyled of his earthlie garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, that apparaileth the ſainctes with the garmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of immortalitie? How was he profered moſt bitter gaull, that geueth vs the bread of heauen? How was he offered vyneger to drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, that geueth vs the cuppe of ſaluation? he that was ſo innocent: he that was ſo iuſt, or rather verie innocencie and iuſtice it ſelfe, was accompted emonge theeues, the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting truth was accuſed with falſe witnes, the iudge of the whole worlde was condemned by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicked men, and the worde of god receaued the ſentence of death with ſylence? Conſider moreouer, at what tyme the Sauiour of the worlde was nailed vpon the croſſe, and at the verie houre of his death, when the ſterres we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re obſcured, the elementes troubled, when the earth quaked, when the light was darkened: when the ſonne tourned awaie his eies, and would not ſuffer his beames to ſhyne vpon the earth, leaſt happelie it might ſee ſuch a great crueltie: Conſider (I ſaie) how euen at this ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me our Sauiour did not ſo much as once open his mouthe, or moue him ſelfe: how he would
<pb facs="tcp:872:58"/>not at the verie laſt howre, and point of death, diſcouer the glorie of his maieſtie, but ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red continuallie that extreme, and violent conflict, euen vntill the ende, intendinge the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby to leaue vnto vs, an example of perfect pacience.</p>
                        <p>Yea, moreouer and all this, if thoſe cruell blouddie miniſters, that crucified, and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his moſt bleſſed bodie, would haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, and bene penitente, he was readie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue them to his grace, and fauour, euen at the verie laſt inſtant: neither would he haue ſhut vp the gates of his church from anie man. Now therefore, what thinge in the worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de can poſſiblie be of greater benignitie, and patience, then the bloude of Chriſt, that giue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the life, euen vnto them, that ſhed the ſame bloude? But ſuch, and ſo great, is the patience of our ſweete Sauiour Chriſt, which if it had not bene ſuch, and of ſo great power, the churche had not had Saint Pawle in it at this daie.

                        </p>
                        <p>This heauenlie bridegrome deſired alſo, to be loued of his ſpouſe, with a paſſinge great loue, and therefore he ordeined this diuine miſticall morſell, conſecrated with ſuch wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, that whoſoeuer receaueth it worthelie, is forthwith towched, and ſtriken with this loue. O wonderfull miſterie, worthie to be engraued euen in the innermoſt parte of our hartes. Tell me (o thou vngratefull man) if a prince ſhould beare ſuch a great affection and loue towardes a ſeelie wenche, that were his bond ſlaue, that he coulde finde in his hart, to take her for his ſpouſe, and make her que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and ladie, of all he is Lord of, how great woulde we ſaie, that the loue of that prince had bene, that woulde doe ſuch a deede? And if peraduenture after the mariage ſolemnized, this ſlaue ſhould ſhowe her ſelfe coldlie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towardes the prince her huſbande, and he vnderſtandinge the ſame, woulde as a man forlorne, goe to ſeeke with all diligence for ſome pretious morſell, and geue it her to ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, whereby to winne her loue vnto him, how paſſinge great would we ſaie that the loue of that prince were, that ſhould be thus affected towardes her? Now therefore (O kinge of
<pb facs="tcp:872:61"/>glorie) what meaneth this, that thou (for the entiere loue thou beareſt vnto me) haſt vouc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſafed not onely to take my ſoule, to be thy ſpouſe, (beinge as ſhe was the verie bonde ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue of thine ennemie the deuill,) but ſeinge her alſo, all this notwithſtandinge verie coldlie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towardes thee, haſt ordeined for her this miſticall and diuine morſell, which thou haſt transformed with ſuch wordes, that it hath vertu in it, to transforme ſuch ſoules in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, as ſhall feede thereon, and make them to burne with liuelie flames of loue? There is no one thinge that declareth the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of loue more euidentlie, then when a man hath a deſire to be beloued. Conſidering therefore that thou haſt bene ſo greatlie deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of our loue, that thou haſt ſowght it with ſuch ſtrange inuentions, who ſhall from hence forth ſtand in dowte of thy loue?<note place="margin">we be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne that if we loue God, God will loue vs agayne.</note> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne I am (o may moſt louinge and mercifull Lord) that if I loue thee, thou alſo loueſt me: And certayne I am alſo, that I neede not to ſeeke anie inuentions to allure thy hart to loue me, as thou haſt ſowght toi allure my har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te to loue thee.</p>
                        <p>That moſt ſweet bridegrome would alſo be abſent from his ſpouſe,<note place="margin">The fifte cauſe.</note> and yet becauſe loue cannot abide to be abſente from the beloued, he would depart in ſuch wiſe, that he might not altogether departe from her, and he would ſo goe awaie, that he might alſo remaine with her. wherefore conſideringe that it was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:872:61"/>for our Sauiour to tarrie here ſtill, and the ſpouſe mighte not as then goe from hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce with him, he deuiſed a meane, that althowgh he went his waie, and his ſpouſe remained ſtill behinde, yet ſhould they neuer be ſeperated and ſet a ſonder. For this cauſe therefore, he inſtituted this diuine ſacrament, that by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes thereof, the ſoules might be vnited, and incorporated ſpirituallie with Chriſt, and that with ſuch a ſtronge bonde of loue, that of them two, there ſhould be made one thinge. For like as of meate, and of him that eateth the meate, there is made one ſame thinge: euen ſo likewiſe, after a certeine maner, is there made of the ſoule, and of Chriſt: ſauinge that (as Sainct Auguſtine ſaith) Chriſt is not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into our ſoules,<note place="margin">S.

                        <p>Moreouer, our Sauiours will and pleaſure was, to aſſure his ſpouſe,<note place="margin">The ſixte cauſe.</note> and to geue her a pledge of that bleſſed inheritance of eternall glorie, that ſhe being fortified with the hope of this felicitie,<note place="margin">An aſſured hope to enioye the felicitie in the kinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to deſpiſe all worlde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie thinges.</note> might paſſe chearfullie throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe all the trowbles, aduerſities, afflictions and perſecutions of this life.

                        <p>To conclude,<note place="margin">The eighte cauſe.</note> our Sauiour intended to lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue vnto our ſoules ſufficient prouiſion, and foode, wherewith they might liue: forſo much as the ſoule hath no leſſe nede of her proper ſuſtenance,<note place="margin">The ſoule hathe as greate nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, as the bodie ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.</note> to maintein her in the ſpirituall life, then the bodie hath of his propre foode, for mayntenance of the corporall life. If thou thinke otherwiſe, tell me (I praie thee,) why hath the bodie neede of his ordinarie meat euerie daie? vndowtedlie the cauſe is, for that the naturall heat continuallie waſteth, and conſumeth the ſubſtance of our bodies, and therefore it is nedefull, that that be reſtored againe with daielie ſuſtenance, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with dailie heat.

This is that, which inclineth vs to the loue of the world, of our fleſhe, of all vices, of all ſenſuall pleaſures, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes: and ſo by theſe meanes ſeperateth vs from almightie God, maketh vs to relente and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xe colde in the loue of him, and cauſeth vs to become verie dull, ſlouthfull, and heauie to all good workes, and verie quicke and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelie to worke all wickednes.

                        <p>Conſider alſo in this place, on the one ſide, the great agonie, and watchinge of our Sauiour Chriſt, and on the other, the ſownde and deepe ſleepinge of his diſciples: and thou ſhalt ſee here repreſented a great miſterie. For trulie there is nothinge more to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the worlde, then to ſee how careles and negligent men be in there liues, and how little accompt they make of a matter of ſo great importance, as is theire owne ſaluation.

Now if thou wilt vnderſtand both the one, and the other, conſider in this matter, the doinges of our ſauiour, and withall the doinges of his diſciples.

Vndowtedlie both the heauens, and the earthe, trembled, and quaked, at this ſo paſſinge great humilitie, and charitie of our Sauiour. So ſoone as theſe

If the ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the medecine doe cauſe thee to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: conſider the greatnes of the wounde, and thou ſhalt ſee, that ſuch a wounde required ſo ſharpe a medecine as this was: eſpetiallie conſideringe that all this notwithſtandinge, the wounde is not yet whole. Thou wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to ſee how almightie God hath humbled himſelfe: And I wonder to ſee thee (for all this example) ſo prowde and inſolent in all thy talke, dealinges, and behauiour, ſeinge almightie God hath ſo humbled himſelfe, to teache thee to be hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble.

                        <p>How is it then, that this ſo wonderfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſufficeth not to ſubdue the pryde of the worlde? The humilitie of Chriſt was ſufficient to ouercome the harte of God, to procure his fauour, and to make him become gentle and mylde towardes vs. And ſhall it not ſuffice to ouercome thy harte, and to make it humble and meike?

For ſeinge thou haſt bene mightie againſt God, how much more ſhalt thou be mightie againſt men?</hi> If then the humilitie and meike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our Sauiour Chriſt preuailed againſt the furie, and wrathe of almightie God: why doth it not preuaile againſt our pride? If it we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re able to pacifie and appeaſe ſo mightie a hart, as the hart of almightie God, beinge then angrie with vs, why doth it not alter and mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie our ſtubborne hartes? Suerly I am at my wittes ende, and verie much aſtoniſhed, yea it paſſeth my reaſon to conſider how this ſo great patience ouercommeth not thy anger, how this paſſinge great abaſinge aſwageth not thy pride, how theſe violent buffettes beate not downe thy preſumption, and how this deepe ſylence emonge ſo manie iniuries is not of force to make thee leaue of thy quarrelin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and troubleſome ſewtes in lawe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

It is a meruailous great wonder to ſee how almightie God would by meanes of theſe ſo terrible iniuries ouerthrowe the kingdome of our pride: and it is alſo greatlie to be meruailed at, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandinge all this, there remaineth yet a freſhe liuelie memorie of Amelec vnder the heauens,<note place="margin">4 <hi>Reg.</hi> 15.</note> and that to this daie the relikes of this wicked generation doe for all that remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and continewe.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>ONSIDER after this, what trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles our ſauiour ſuffered in that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefull night, when the ſouldiars that had him in cuſtodie, mocked and lawghed him to ſcorne (as S. Luke ſaieth,<note place="margin">

Conſider now (ô my ſowle) how thy ſweete ſpowſe is ſet here as a marcke, to receiue all the ſtrokes and buffettes they could geue him. O cruell night! O vnquiet night, in which thou (O good Ieſus) tookeſt no reſt at all, neither did the ſouldiars repoſe them ſelues, but accompted it euen a paſtyme and recreation to vexe, and torment thee! The night was ordeined for this ende, that all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhoulde therein take theire reſt, and that the ſenſes and members that are wearied with the toyles and labours of the daie, might be refreſſhed, and relieued: but theſe wicked men vſe it now as a fit tyme to tormente all thy members, and ſenſes, ſtrykinge thy bodie, affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctinge thy ſowle, bindinge thy handes, buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge thy cheekes, ſpittinge in thy face, and lugginge thee by the eares, that at ſuch time as all members are wonte to take theire reſt,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:872:86"/>all thy members might be in great paine, and trouble. O how farre do theſe mattins differre from thoſe, which the orders of angells ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge at the ſame time in heauen vnto thee! The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re they ſynge, Holie, Holie: but here theſe caitifes crie out: put him to death: put him to death: crucifie him: crucifie him. O ye angel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of Paradiſe, that heard both theſe voices, what thowghte ye, when ye ſawe him ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitefullie contemned in earthe, whom ye honoure with ſo greate reuerence in heauen? What thowght ye, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye ſawe almightie God himſelfe ſuffer ſuch deſpites euen for theire ſakes, who did all this villanie vnto him? Who hath euer heard of ſuch a kinde of charitie, that one woulde ſuffer death to deliuer the verie ſame perſons from death, that were the procurers of his death? Aſſuredlie, the malice of man coulde not anie further extende it ſelfe in committinge a more wicked deede, than thus to preſume to laie handes vpon almightie God him ſelfe: neither coulde the goodnes and mercie of almightie God appeare more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in anie thinge, than in this, that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſuffer ſuch a cruell death for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie creature that conſpired his deathe.</p>
                        <p>The painfull greifes and turmoyles of this troubleſome night were increaſed farre the more by the denyall of S. Peter. For he,<note place="margin">Of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of S.

Peter in Math. 16. verſ. 18. that he woulde buylde his Church vpon him. And in Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke. 22. verſ. 32. he was bid (after he ſhoulde repent his denyall) to confirme his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. And in Iohn. 21. verſ. 17. Chriſt after his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made S. Peter pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor of all his ſheepe.</note> to haue the pincipalitie and cheife rule of the whole Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che: this verie cheife Apoſtle (I ſaie,) firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all others, not once, but three ſeuerall ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes together, euen in the verie preſence of his Lorde and maſter, ſweareth and forſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that he knoweth him not, and that he wiſt not who he is.</p>
                        <p>O Peter, is he that ſtandeth there by thee ſo wicked a man, that thou accompteſt it ſo great a ſhame onelie to haue knowen him? Conſider, that this is a condemnation of him by thee, before he be condemned by the high preiſtes: ſithence by this deniall thou geueſt the worlde to vnderſtande, that he is ſuch a maner of man, that euen thou thy ſelfe doeſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt it as a greate reproche and diſhonour vnto thee euer to haue knowen him. Now what greater iniurie coulde be done than this?</p>
                        <p>Our Sauiour then hearinge this deniall tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned backe, and behelde Peter, and caſt his eies vpon that ſhepe, which there was loſt from him. O looke of wounderfull vertue! O ſilent looke, but yet full of miſterie, and ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! Peter vnderſtode right well the langwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge and voice of that looke, and althowgh the crowinge of the Cocke was not able to awake his ſpirites, yet was this able, as indeede it did. For the eies of our Sauiour Chriſte doe not onelie ſpeake, but alſo worke, as it plainlie
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:872:87"/>appeared by the teares of Peter, which albeit they guſhed from the eies of Peter, yet did they much more proceide from the looke and eies of Chriſte.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore when thou ſhalt at anie time awake againe out of thy ſinfull lyfe, and with greife and ſorowe call thy ſinnes to minde wherein thou haſt offended almightie God, thou muſt vnderſtande, that this benefit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceideth from the mercifull eies of our Lorde, which doe then looke vpon thee. The Coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes had alreadie crowed, but Peter remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred not himſelfe, becauſe our ſauiour had not as yet looked vpon him. But when our Sauiour Chriſt looked vpon him, then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred him ſelfe, and repented and bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his offence. For the eies of Chriſt doe open our eies, and thoſe are the eies that doe awake ſuch as are a-ſleepe.</p>
                        <p>The holie Euangeliſtes S. Mathew and S. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke ſaye, that Peter went out forthwith,<note place="margin">

For otherwiſe to lamente and be ſorie alwaies for thy ſinnes, and alwaies to reiterate and commit the ſame ſinnes agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, is to prouoke alwaies the wrathe and anger of almightie God againſt thee.</p>
                        <p>And note well and diligentlie this poynt eſpetiallie,<note place="margin">A diſciple of Chriſt muſt not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, nor afearde, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penlic to confeſſe Chriſt, and his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> that the principall ſinne that Peter

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:872:91"/>his moſt cruell ennemies, he determined to punniſhe our ſauiour with ſuch a ſeuere kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of punniſhement, as might ſuffice to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the malicious outrage of ſuch cruell har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, that they beinge contented therewith ſhoulde ceaſe, and ſeeke no more after his deathe.</p>
                        <p>This is one of the greateſt, and moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull ſightes, that euer was ſeene in the worlde.

This is the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den propiciatorie: this is the rainbowe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers colours, placed emonge the clowdes of heauen, with the ſight whereof almightie God is pacified.

Compare then eies, with eies: perſon, with perſon: and thou ſhalt ſee, how much thou art more aſſured of the mercie of the heauenlye father, by preſentinge vnto him this dolefull forme of our Sauiour Chriſt, than Pilate was of the mercie of the Iewes, when he ſhowed our Sauiour thus pittiefully disfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto them.

O what a ſtrange combatte was there now of feare, and loue, in the dolorous harte of the moſt bleſſed virgin Marie? In one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte ſhe had a deſiere to ſee him, and in an other, ſhe was vnwillinge to ſee him thus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerablie and moſt cruelly disfigured. At the lengthe, when ſhe was come where ſhe might

Why com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt thou hither my doue, my beloued, and my deere mother? Thy ſorowe increaſeth my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and thy tormentes do augment my pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and be a great torment vnto me: Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te my deere mother, departe I beſeach thee, and retourn home againe to thy howſe. For it is not ſeemelie for thy virginall ſhamefaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and puretie, to be here in the companie of murderers, and theeues. And if it woulde pleaſe thee ſo to doe, it woulde certeinly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage both thy ſorrowe, and myne. And I will remaine here to be ſacrificed for the worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de. For this office apperteineth not to thee, but vnto me, and thy innocencie deſerueth not this torment.<note place="margin">Geneſ. <hi>8.</hi>

This griefe and ſorrowe ſo poſſeſſeth my harte, that trewlie I can not thinke vpon anie other thinge. I can goe no whither without thee; neither can I ſeeke, or receaue comfort of any other, but of thee. Vpon thee, is fixed all my whole harte. Within thee, haue I made my habitation. And my life whollie dependeth of thee. Seinge therefore thou haſt vowche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaffed for the ſpace of nine monethes to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite within my bowels, and to take my bodie for thy dwellinge place, why maye not I for theſe three daies, take thy bowels for my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation? If thou wilt thus receaue me within thee, when thou art crucified, then ſhall I be crucified with thee: and when thou arte bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, then ſhall I be buried alſo together with thee.

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:872:128"/>become a widowe? What? haue they ſet ſo ſore a penaltie vpon thee, without hauinge committed anie offence at all? O moſt holie virgin, I woulde gladly comfort thee, and I knowe not how? I woulde gladly eaſe ſome parte of thy great greifes, and anguiſhes, and I knowe not which waie? O Quene of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, if the cauſe of thy ſorrowes, were the ſorrowes of thy bleſſed ſonne, and not thine owne, (for that thou diddeſt loue him more then thy ſelfe,) his ſorrowes are now ended, forſomuch as his bodie ſuffereth no more, and his ſoule is now altogether glorious. Cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe therefore (I beſeach thee) the multitude of thy ſorrowfull ſighes, and bewailinges, ſein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge the cauſe of thy ſorowe is alreadie ceaſed, and gonne.

                        </p>
                        <p>I ſee well ô bleſſed Ladie, that none of all theſe thinges are able to comforte thee: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thy ſorrowe, and greife is not hereby taken awaie, but onely changed.

The tormentes of thy harte are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed continuallie, and thowgh ſome goe awaie, yet others do ſuccede with newe kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of tormentes: that by ſuch changes, the torment of the Paſſion maie be dowbled vnto thee. Hetherto thou haſt lamented his pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and ſorrowes: now thou lamenteſt his death.

                        <p>And as though this thy paine were to litle, I ſee that theſe cruell tormentors prepare yet an other paine for thee, no leſſe then this, Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe vp thine eies therefore ô bleſſed Ladie: cloſe them vp out of hande I beſeach thee: and loke not vpon that longe terrible ſpeare, which goeth with greate violence in the aier, to ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke the place wherevnto it is leuelled, Now haſt thou ô holie virgin thy deſire fulfilled. For now arte thou become a buckler to thy ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, forſomuch as this blowe ſtriketh not him, but thee. Thou diddeſt deſire the nailes, and thornes, and they were ordeyned for his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: but the pearcinge ſpeare was reſerued for thee. O yee cruell miniſters? O yee hartes of iron? Were the paines, and tormentes to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle (trowe yee) which his bodie ſuffered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge aliue; that yee woulde not pardon it euen after it was dead? What furie and rancor of enmitie is there ſo outragious, but that it is pacified when it ſeeth his enemie dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him? Lifte vp your cruell eies a litle ô you vnmercifull and cruell miniſters, and beholde our ſauiour? Beholde I ſaie his deadlie face, his dymme eies, his fallinge countenance, his pale and wanne colour, and ſhadow of death. For though you be more harde, than either iron, or the Adamante ſtone: yea though ye be more hard, than your owne ſelues, yet it maie be, that in beholdinge him, your furie and malice wilbe appeaſed. Wherefore are ye not contented with the woundes yee haue geuen
<pb facs="tcp:872:130"/>to the ſonne, but that ye will wounde his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mother alſo? Her ye doe wounde with that ſpeare: vnto her ye geue the ſtrooke: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her ſorowfull hart threateneth the ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe poynt of that cruell lawnce.</p>
                        <p>Now commeth the wicked miniſter with a longe ſharpe ſpeare in his hande, and pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the verie naked ſyde of our ſauiour with great furie. The croſſe ſhaked in the aier with the mightie force of the ſtrooke: and from thence iſſued water, and bloude, wherewith are waſſhed the ſinnes of the worlde. O riuer that ronneſt out of paradiſe, and watereſt with thy ſtreames all the face of the earthe!

                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:872:131"/>
                        <p>Now the verie ſame daie in the eueninge, there came thoſe two holie men, Ioſeph, and Nicodemus, who reared vp theire ladders vnto the croſſe, and tooke downe the bleſſed bodie of our Sauiour into theire armes. The holie virgin then perceiuinge that the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the croſſe was now ended, and that the ſacred bodie of our Sauiour was commin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge towardes the earthe, ſhe ſettethe her ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe in a readines to geue him a ſecure hauen in her lappe, and to receyue him from the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of the croſſe, into her owne armes. And ſo ſhe wryngeth her handes verie pittiefullie, and requeſteth of thoſe noble men with great humilitie, and inſtancie, that forſomuch as ſhe had taken no leaue of her deerelie belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſonne, nor receaued thoſe laſt embracin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of him vpon the croſſe at the tyme of his departure, they woulde now ſuffer her to come vnto him, and not encraſe her diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte on euerie ſyde. She beſeacheth them, that they woulde not deale ſo ſtraitly with her, as the enemies had done, takinge her ſweete ſonne from her beinge now dead, as the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies did, whiles he was yet aliue. O bleſſed Ladie, how voide of comforte arre thou on euerie ſyde? For if they denie thee thy requeſt, thou wilt be ſore diſcomforted: and if they graunte thee thy petition (accordinge to thy earneſt deſire) yet ſhall thy diſcomfort be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a whit diminiſhed. Thy miſeries haue no comfort at all, but onely in thy patience. If
<pb facs="tcp:872:132"/>thou goe about on the one ſide to diminiſhe thy ſorrowe, on the other ſide it increaſeth dowble. Now ye holie men, what will yee doe in this caſe? What is your beſt aduice, and counſell, in this matter? To geue a flat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall vnto ſuch lamentable teares, and to ſo bleſſed a Ladie, in ſo iuſt and reaſonable a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, were certainlie an vnſeemlie acte: and to graunt her the thinge ſhe demaundeth, were to ende her life. You are afrayd on the one ſyde to diſcomfort her: and on th'other ſyde you feare alſo leaſt perhappes you ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de be murderers of the mother, as the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were of the ſonne. In concluſion the pittiefull earneſtnes of the holie virgin ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth them, and thoſe noble men thought beſt, that conſideringe her great dolefull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailinge, and lamentation, it ſhoulde be a greater crueltie to take her owne deare ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, than to bereiue her of her life. And ſo they were enforced to graunte her requeſt.</p>
                        <p>Now when the bleſſed virgin had by her pittiefull interceſſion gotten the bodie of her deare ſonne into her armes, what tonge is able to expreſſe the greate inwarde anguiſhe and ſorrowe which then ſhe felte? O ye angells of peace, weepe with this holie virgin. O ye heauens, lament with her. O ye ſterres of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and all creatures of the worlde, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie the bleſſed virgin Marie in her great heauines and dolefull lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tation. The bleſſed mother embraceth the torne, and rent bodie
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:872:132"/>of her ſweete ſonne. She huggeth, and clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth him faſt to her breſt, (her ſtrengthe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge her to this thinge onely:) She putteth downe her face betwene the thornes of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred head. She ioyneth countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. The face of the mother is embrued with the bloude of the ſonne: and the face of the ſonne is bathed with the teares of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. O ſweete mother, is this happly thy ſweete sonne? Is this he, whom thou concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedſt with ſo great glorie, and broughteſt fourthe with ſo great ioye? Where are now thy former ioyes become? Whither is thy wonted gladnes gone? Where is now that mirrour of beawtie, wherein thou diddeſt ſo often times beholde thy ſelfe? Now thou ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt no pleaſure to beholde him in the face, becauſe his eies haue loſt their light? Now it auayleth thee not to ſpeake, and talke with him, becauſe his eares haue loſt their hearin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge? Now that tonge moueth not, which was wont to vtter the wordes of heauen. Now are thoſe eies dimmed, which were wont with thei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſighte to reioyce the whole worlde. How is it, that thou ſpeakeſt not now (ô Quene of heauen?) How happeneth it, that verie ſorrowe, and heauines, hath thus tyed vp thy to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge? Trew it is, that the tonge of the bleſſed virgin was as it were domme for a tyme: but her harte might ſecretly with inward greife ſpeake vnto her ſweete, and dearelie beloued ſonne, and ſaie vnto him.</p>

                        <p>What thinge is tribulation, but onely a croſſe?

                        <p>And let no man be diſcomforted, and ſaie, that he ſuffereth for his ſynnes, or without ſynne: for howſoeuer thou ſuffer, all is final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye in effect to ſuffer vpon the croſſe.

                        <p>It is alſo ſayd that our Lorde made this daye, becauſe whatſoeuer was done in it, was done onely by his owne hande.

For whereas he owght to haue emploied vs in the ſeruice and glorie of our Creator, he hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de vs to ſerue the will and pleaſure of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, peruertinge all ſuch thinges to the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and reproche of the creator, as he had crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his ſeruice. His ſoule was beawtified with the image of God, and he hath disfigured this diuine image, and clothed it with our vyle image and likenes. He hath bene more earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie than the earthe it ſelfe: more ſlipperie than the water: more mutable than the wynde: mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re enkendeled in his appetites, than the fire: more hardened than the verie ſtones: more cruell againſt him ſelfe, than the wylde bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes: more ſpitefull and venemous againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, than the verie Cockatrice. What neede I to vſe manie wordes? He hath neither feared almightie God, nor made accompte of men, and therefore he hath caſt abroade his poyſon (as much as in him laie) vpon manye perſones, alluringe them to beare him companie in his ſynnes and wickednes.

If almightie God did not fulfill his appetites and deſires, or if he ſent him anie troubles, or aduerſities, he was in as great an anger, and rage againſt him, as he woulde haue bene againſt one of his owne ſeruantes. In all his doeinges he woulde be prayſed, as well in the wicked, as in the good, as thoughe he had bene almightie God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to whome onely it appertaineth to be praiſed in all his workes: forſomuche as all that he dothe is good, or ordeyned to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.

And becauſe I alone am not ſufficient to abhorre, and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe my ſelſe, I will ioyne all creatures in the whole worlde vnto me, and will deſire to be punniſhed, and deſpiſed by euerie one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, forſomuche as I haue deſpiſed the Creator of them all.

Wherefore I am contented that all diſhonors, reproches, and punniſhementes doe ronne vpon me on euerie ſide, ſo that by them I maie be brought to my moſt ſweete, and mercifull Lorde. And as for all honour, pleaſure, and delighte, they ſhalbe banniſhed awaie quyte from me, inſomuch as the verie names of them ſhall no more be harde in my howſe. In all thinges I will ſeeke nothinge

Now as towchinge the time that is ſpent in ſleepe, I ſee not how it maye be called the time of lyfe, ſeinge the principall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of our life is to haue the vſe of our ſenſes and reaſon, which as then both the one and the other are ſuſpended in vs, and as it were deade.</p>
                        <p>And therefore a certayne Philoſopher ſaied, that in the halfe of a mans lyfe there is no difference betwene the happie man, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie: forſomuch as duringe the tyme of ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe all men are equall, becauſe they be then as is were deade. It is cleare, that if a kinge ſhoulde be detained as a priſoner for the ſpace of one or two yeares, we can not ſaie (and ſaie trulie) that he raigned duringe that time, ſeinge he enioyed not the kingdome, nor go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned the ſame lyke a kinge. How then can it be ſaied, that a man liueth whiles he ſleepeth, ſeinge duringe that time, the Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnorie and vſe of his reaſon, yea and of his ſenſes alſo, by which he liueth, ſtande as it were in ſuſpenſe? For this cauſe a certain Poët tearmed ſleepe the coſin germayne of death,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:872:178"/>and an other called it the brother of deathe, for the likenes and reſemblance, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued to be betwene the one, and the other. Now then if ſo great a parte of our lyfe be ſpent in ſleepe, what a great part is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it cannot be ſayed that we doe liue at all. And if it be the common cuſtome of men to ſleepe the thirde parte of the daie, and night, which is eight whole howres, (although there be a great ſorte,<note place="margin">The thirde parte of our lyfe is conſumed in ſleepe.</note> that doe not content them ſelues therewith) it followeth by this accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pte that the thirde parte of our lyfe is conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in ſleepe, and ſo conſequently, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe that time we doe not liue. So that he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby thou mayſt perceaue, what a great parte of our ſhort lyfe is ſpent in ſleepe euerie daie. This accompte therefore beinge thus made, (which vndowtedly is a very true accompt) how muche is that, that remaineth of a mans verie lyfe in deede, euen of ſuche I meane, as liue longeſt?</p>
                        <p>Certainlie that philoſopher had verie great reaſon to doe as he did, who beinge demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what he thought of the lyfe of a man, tourned him ſelfe about before them that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de the demaunde, and ſodeinly departed out of their ſight.

Our lyfe is no more, but as it were the ſhotinge of a ſterre, that paſſeth at a tryce, and flaſſheth quickly awaie, and within a litle while after,

For within verie fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we daies after a man is departed owt of this lyfe, the verie remembrance of him dieth with his lyfe, be the perſonage neuer ſo great, or honorable. To conclude, this lyfe ſeemed ſo ſhorte to manie of the auncient wiſemen, that one of them tearmed it a dreame: and an other not contented therewith, called it the dreame of a ſhadowe, ſeeminge to him that it was ouermuch to calle it the dreame of a true thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge in deede, beinge as he thought it none other than a dreame of a vaine and friuolous thinge.</p>

For although ye kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we not certainly what yeare he will call you, yet moſt certaine it is, that a yeare ſhall come in which vndowtedlie he will call you.</p>
                        <p>But that the force of this reaſon maie the better be perceaued, let vs put an example. Tell me if there were ſet before thee vpon a table thirtie or fourtie ſeuerall diſſhes of meat, and thou haddeſt a certaine warninge geuen thee by ſome of thy friendes, that in one of them there were poiſon: durſt thou geue the aduenture to eate of anie one of them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe thou were verie muche a hungered? Vndowtedlie thou wouldeſt not doe it. For the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:872:181"/>verie feare thou wouldeſt haue, leaſt thou mighteſt peraduenture light vpon that diſhe that were poyſoned, woulde make thee to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from all the reſt. Now let vs examin how manie yeares at the vttermoſt thou mayſt hope yet to liue. Thou wilt ſaie peraduenture (after thou haſt well conſidered the matter) that thou mayeſt liue thirtie or fourtie yeares. Well then if it be certaine, that in one of theſe yeares thou art aſſured to die, and thou kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt weſt not in which of them, why art thou not then affraide in euerie one of them, ſeinge thou art well aſſured, that in one of them thy lyfe ſhalbe taken from thee? Thou wouldeſt not be ſo hardie, as to put thy hande into anie one of the foreſaied fourtie diſſhes, although thou were in a verie ſore honger, becauſe thou knoweſt that in one of them there is death pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And wilt thou not alſo be affraide of euerie one of theſe fourtie yeares, ſeinge thou art ſo well aſſured, that thou ſhalt die in one of theſe yeares? What anſwere canſt thou make to this reaſon?</p>
                        <p>Harken yet to an other reaſon, which is of no leſſe efficacie than the other. Tell me, why doe men keepe a continuall watche in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell that ſtandeth in the frontiers vpon the enemies? Is it for anie other cauſe, but onely for that they knowe not when the enemies will come to aſſaulte it? Aſſuredlie for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne other. So that becauſe they knowe not certainly at what time the enemie will co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, therefore doe they continuallie watche it
<pb facs="tcp:872:182"/>at all tymes. For if they knewe certainlie the time of their comminge, they might be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les in the meane while, and reſerue the dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their watche vntill that verie time. Now I require thee hartely for the loue of God, to be an indifferent Iudge towchinge that, which I ſhall ſaye vnto thee. Let vs conſider well this poynte. If thou watche thy Caſtle euerie nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, becauſe thou art vncertain when thy enemie will come, whether to daie, or to morrowe, this yeare, or the next: why doeſt thou not then kepe a continuall watche ouer thy ſoule, ſeinge thou knoweſt not what howre death ſhall come to geue the aſſault vpon thee? The verie ſame vncertaintie that is in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, is in thy ſoule alſo: yea this vncertaintie is farre more, and the matter is without all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of greater importance. Now what iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement haue they that are alwayes ſo vigilant in watchinge their caſtle, and ſo careles alwayes abowt their ſoules: ſo careles I ſaie, as to ſleepe alwaies, without euer thinkinge vpon them? What thinge can be more againſt reaſon? Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For I praie thee, what glaſſe is ſo brickle and ſo ſubiecte to kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckes and breakinge, as the lyfe of man? Some times the verie aier, and heat of the ſonne (if it be vehement) is able to ſpoyle vs of our lyfe. But what ſpeake I of the ſonne? ſeinge the verie eies, yea the onely lookinge of ſome perſone is able ſometimes to bereaue a creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of his lyfe.

Conſider now what a ſure caſtell this is, wherein the treaſure of our lyfe is kept, ſeinge the onelie beholdinge of it a farre of, is able to batter it cleane downe to the grownde.</p>
                        <p>But this were not ſo much to be wondered at in the age of infancie, when the buildinge is as yet but newe, and griene: but the greater wonder is, that after that the worke is ſetled, and hath continued manie yeares together, there happeneth ſome accident of no greater importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce than theſe beforenamed that is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le vtterlie to ouerthrowe it. If thou enquire and aſke whereof dyed this man, or whereof died that man, they will anſwere thee, that he died by drinkinge a cuppe of colde drinke in a ſweat: or by ſurfetinge at a ſupper: or of ſome other great pleaſure, or greife: and ſome times they can geue no cauſe at all, but that he went to his bed ſaffe, and ſounde, and the next daie in the morninge was founde ſtarke dead at his wiues ſyde. Is there any glaſſe or earthen veſſell in the worlde more brickle or ſubiecte to breakynge than this? And certainle it is not to be wondered at, that man is ſo brickle, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deringe that he is alſo made of earth: but it is rather to be wondered at, that beinge of ſuch ſtuffe, and makinge as he is, he is able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſo longe a time as he doth. Why is a clocke ſo often times diſordered, and out of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:872:183"/>frame? The reaſon is becauſe it hath ſo manie wheeles, and pointes, and is ſo full of artificiall worke, that although it be made of yron, yet euerie litle thinge is able to diſtemper it. Now how much more tender is the artificiall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of our bodies, and how much more fraile is the matter of our fleaſhe, than is the yron, whereof a clocke is made? Wherefore if the artificiall compoſition of our bodies be more tender, and the matter more fraile, why ſhoulde we wonder if ſome one pointe emon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge ſo manie wheeles haue ſome impediment, by reaſon of which defect it ſtoppeth, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the courſe of our lyfe? Trewlye, we haue rather good cauſe to meruayle, not why men doe ſo quickly ende their liues, but how they endure ſo longe, the woorckmanſhippe of their bodies beinge ſo tender, and the matter and ſtuffe whereof they be compounded ſo fraile and weake.</p>
                        <p>This is that miſerable frailtie, which the Prophet Eſaie ſignifieth in theſe wordes. <hi>Almightie God ſaied vnto his Prophet: Crie:</hi>

                           <hi>the Prophet anſwered: what ſhall I ſaie? God ſaied vnto him: All fleaſh is haie, and all the glorie thereof is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke vnto the flower of the feild. the haie wythereth, the floure fadeth awaye, but the worde of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth for euer.</hi>

Trulie it is euen ſo, for the glorie of man floriſheth in the fleaſhe like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to haie, which althoughe it ſeeme to be great, it is in verie deede but litle like an hearbe: it
<pb facs="tcp:872:184"/>buddeth like a floure, and fadeth like haie. So that it hath no more, but a certain floriſhinge in apparance, and no firmenes nor ſtabilitie in the fruite. For what firmenes can there be in the matter of fleaſhe, or what good thinges of anie longe continuance are to be founde in ſo weake a ſubiect? To daye thou mayeſt ſee a yonge ſtriplinge in the moſt floriſhinge ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of his age, with great ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, luſtie, and iet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge vp and downe in the ſtreetes in great bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie, with a iolye loftie countenance: and if it ſo fall out that this verie next night he be taken with ſome diſeaſe, thou ſhalt ſee him the next daie with a face ſo farre altered, and chaunged, that whereas before he ſeemed verie amiable and beautifull, he will now ſeeme euill fauored, miſerable, and verie irck ſome to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde. Now what ſhall I ſaie of the other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentes, and alterations of our bodies? Some are ſore broken with troubles, and aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: others are weakened with pouertie: others are tormented for want of good digeſtion: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are diſtempered with drinkinge of wines: others waxe feeble with age: others become tender, and ouer delicate by much cheriſhinge them ſelues: and others marre their comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion with vſinge ryotous behauiour.

                        <p>Vpon this affiance were thoſe prowde, and ſumptuous buildinges of the Magare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces built, of whom a certaine Philoſopher ſaieth, that they builded as thoughe they ſhoulde liue for euer,<note place="margin">The cauſe why manie be ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for this worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, and ſo careles and negligent to prepare them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to dye.</note> and they liued as though they ſhould dye the next daye.

This falſe imagination maketh vs to beleue, that we haue time enough for all thinges: for the worlde, for pleaſures, for vanities, for vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and for many other vaine, and curious exerciſes: and that yet after all this, we ſhall haue time enough alſo before we dye, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyde our accompte redie, and to make our attonemente with almightie God. Inſomuch that like as we make our accompt of a pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of clothe when it lieth vpon a table befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re vs, appointinge one piece for one purpoſe, and an other piece for an other: euen ſo doe we make an accompt of our liues, as thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe we our ſelues had the ſeignorie and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement of times, and might diſpoſe both of them, and of our lyfe, at our owne wil and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.

The which as it hateth and abhorreth death exceadinglie, ſo will it in no caſe haue any remembrance of it, nor be perſwaded, that it will come ſo ſoone to his howſe as to other mens.

For this conſideration ſerueth verie well both for the one, and the other. But wilt thou vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:872:195"/>in worde what the glorie of this worlde is? Marke and conſider with attention the ſtate and condition of mans lyfe, and thereby ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te thou perceyue, what the glorie of this lyfe is. Tell me (I praie thee) can the glorie of man be more longe or more ſtable than the lyfe of man? It is moſt certaine that it can not. For this glorie is an accident, which is grownded vpon this lyfe, as vpon his ſubiecte, or foundation, and therefore when the foundation and ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte faileth, the accidentes muſt needes faile withall.<note place="margin">The riches pleaſures and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of this lyfe cannot contynewe anie lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the lyfe it ſelfe.</note> And for this verie cauſe no riches, no pleaſures, not delightes can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinewe any lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger tyme with a man than vntill his graue. Forſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as then faileth the foundation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon all theſe thinges are built, and haue their ſtaie, which foundation is our lyfe. Now tell me then, if this lyfe be ſuch as thou haſt now hearde deſcribed vnto thee: to witt: ſhorte, vncertain, fraile, inconſtante, deceitfull, and miſerable, how longe can the buildinge endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, that ſhalbe framed vpon this foundation? How longe can the accidentes continewe, that ſhalbe grounded vpon ſo weake a ſubſtance? When thou haſt conſidered this point well with thy ſelfe, thou muſt needes ſaye, that they ſhall endure no longer than the foundation and ſubſtance it ſelfe endureth: and thou muſt needes confeſſe, that manie times they endure not ſo longe: as we ſee by dailie experience in the goodes of fortune, which with manie men haue an ende before their lyfe endeth.</p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:872:196"/>
                        <p>Now if that ſayeinge of the Poët Pindarus be true: to witt, That this lyfe is no more, but a dreame of a ſhadowe, What thinkeſt thou then is the glorie of this world, which is of ſhorter continuance than our lyfe? What ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt wouldeſt thou make of a goodly buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge, in caſe it ſtood vpon a falſe foundation? What accompte wouldeſt thou make of an image of waxe, very richlie and curiouſlie wrought, in caſe it were ſet againſt the ſonne, where it is certayne that ſo ſoone as the waxe ſhoulde be molten, forthwith the forme of the image woulde vtterlie be defaced, and leeſe his beautie? Whie doe we make ſo litle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of the beautie of a flowre, but becauſe it groweth vpon ſo weake a ſubiect? For ſo ſoone as it is nypt of from the ſtalke, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinentlie it looſeth his faire gloſſe and beautie? It is not poſſible to haue beautie of anie firme continuance in a matter ſo fraile, and corruptible. It followeth therefore that the glorie of man is ſuch as the lyfe of man is. For although glory doe continewe after the ende of our lyfe, yet what ſhall that glorie auayle him that hath no ſence, nor feelinge thereof? What dothe it auayle Homere now whileſt thou ſo highelie praiſeſt and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt his Iliades? Vndoutedly no more but as S. Ierome ſaieth ſpeakinge of Ariſtotle, Woo be vnto thee Ariſtotle, that art praiſed where thou art not, to witt, here in the worlde: and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:872:196"/>art tormented where thou art indeede: to witt, in hell.</p>
                        <p>Other ineſtimable commodities mayeſt thou gather owt of this conſideration. For if thou doe conſider all theiſe miſeries with good attention, thine eies ſhalbe opened forthwith, and thou ſhalt wonder at the great blindnes of men, yea the verie ſtraungenes of it ſhall cauſe thee to ſaie to thy ſelfe: Good Lorde, what cauſe is there, why this miſerable lignage of Adam ſhoulde waxe prowde! From whence commeth ſuch puffinge and arrogancie of minde, ſuch hawtie and loftie courages, ſo great contempt of others, ſuch eſtimation of our ſelues, and ſo great forgetfulnes of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God? What cauſe haſt thou to be prowde thou duſt, and aſſhes? Why doeſt thou magnifie, and aduaunce thy ſelfe thou ſeely wretche of the earthe? Why doeſt thou not holde downe thy peacockes taile, beholdinge thy fowle feete, to witt, the vylenes of thy ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te and condition? What cauſe haſt thou to ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke ſo carefullie for the glorie of this worlde, ſeinge it is myngled with ſo manie miſeries? What thinge is there ſo ſweete, but that it maie be made bitter with the mixture of ſo manie ſower, and bitter ſawces?</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, if this lyfe be a vale of teares, a priſon of guiltie perſons, and a banniſhement of them that be comdemned, how canſt thou ſettle ſo greate vanitie, ſo great pompe, and pride of the worlde, ſuch gaye ornamentes, and
<pb facs="tcp:872:197"/>ſtatelie furniture of houſes, and families, in the place of teares? How canſt thou imagine to make this a place of paſtymes, and pleaſures, of feaſtes, and bankettes? How canſt thou be ſo diligente to heape ſo greidelie together for the prouiſion of this worlde, and be ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull of the worlde to come, as if thou were borne onely to liue here in earth with brute beaſtes, and haddeſt no parte in heauen with the Angels. Suerlie I muſt neides ſaie, that thou art very much wedded to miſerie, and that thou cameſt out of a meruaylous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſtocke, if ſo manie argumentes of the miſeries of this worlde be not able to open thine eies, and make thee to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerne ſo groſſe and ſo palpable a blindenes,</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE conſideration of death is verie profitable for manie purpoſes, and eſpetially for three. Firſt for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyninge of true wiſedome: that is, to knowe how a man ought to gouerne, and frame his lyfe. For (as the Philoſophers doe ſaie) in thinges that are ordeined to anie ende,<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of death cauſeth a man to gouerne and frame his life.</note> the rule and meaſure whereby to directe them, is to be taken of the ſame ende, and therefore when men doe either builde, or Saile, or doe anie thinge, they haue alwaies their eie fixed vpon the ende which they pretende, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge to the ſame doe frame and direct all the reſt of their doinges. Now conſideringe that emonge the endes and tearmes of our lyfe, death is one of them (whither we goe all to take our reſt) he that will endeuour to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his lyfe in good order, let him fixe his eies vpon this marke, and accordinge to the ſame let him diſpoſe and directe all his affaires. Let him conſider how poore, and naked he muſt depart out of this worlde, and what a
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:872:202"/>ſtrait iudgement he muſt paſſe at the hower of his death, and how he ſhall lie in his graue all betroden, and quyte forgotten of all men: and accordinge to this ende let him conſider how to frame and direct the whole order and courſe of his lyfe. By this rule a certaine Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher gouerned, and directed his lyfe that ſaied: Naked came I out of my mothers wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be,<note place="margin">Iob. <hi>2.</hi>
                           </note> and naked muſt I retourne againe to my graue: To what purpoſe then ſhoulde I loſe my time, in purchaſinge and heapinge together landes, and riches, ſeing nakednes ſhalbe my ende.

For if we woulde conſider, in what caſe we ſhalbe after a fewe daies whan we are once lodged in that poore ſelie cottage of our graue, we ſhoulde be more humble, and more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat in our lyfe. How cowlde he poſſiblye haue anie ſparcke of preſumption, that woulde conſider, that he ſhalbe there duſt, and aſſhes? How cowlde he finde in his harte to make a God of his belly, that woulde conſider that he ſhall become there wormes meate? Who coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de euer be perſwaded to occupie his brayne in ſuch loftie and phantaſticall thoughtes, and deuices, if he did but conſider and wayghe how fraile and weake the foundation is, wherevpon

Who woulde endaunger the loſſe and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of himſelfe, in ſeekinge for riches both by lande, and Sea, if he conſidered that at his death he ſhoulde carie no more with him, but a poore windinge ſheete?

And then made his praier againe, and ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de. <hi>O Lorde open the eies of theſe miſerable men, that they maie ſee where they are.</hi> Now tell me I praie thee, when thoſe men opened their eies, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we whither they were come, (beleuinge cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainlie before, that they went to finde the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye they ſought for,) how amaſed and aſhamed were they when they ſawe how fowlie they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re deceiued. Now what thinge in the worlde coulde make a more liuely reſemblance of the proces and deceites of our lyfe? We all doe
<pb facs="tcp:872:212"/>walke here in this worlde by the waie of our appetites, and deſires. Some ſeeke after golde: others to purchace la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des: others to make great buildinges: others ſeeke for pleaſures, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes: others for offices, and dignities: and each one is fullie perſwaded, that he taketh the beſt and wiſeſt waie to obtein the thinge he diſiereth. But when the terrible preſence of death, and the daunger of our accompt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth the vanitie of our hopes, then findinge our ſelues to be in arrerages for our accompt, we ſhall clearlie perceiue how fowlie we haue bene deceiued: and we ſhall ſee that by follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winge that waie, whereby we thought to haue founde quietnes, and reſt, we finde our perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. O what miſerable men are we? How blindly doe we now wander vp and downe in the worlde? What eies ſhall we then haue? How ſhall our iudgement be then altered? How far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re different ſhall it be from that it was before? Then ſhall we playnelie ſee how all the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of this worlde are miſerable, her goodes falſe, her waies crooked, her hopes vaine, her promiſes lyinge, her pleaſures bitter, her glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſhorte, and vaine: Then ſhall we perceiue (though to late) how her riches were thornes, and her delightes poyſon. To be ſhort, then ſhall we ſee how our eies haue bene cloſed vp, and that we neuer knewe whither we went: and at the ende of our iourney we ſhall finde our ſelues in the ſtreites of Samaria, and in the ſnare of the iudgement of almightie God, and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:872:212"/>compaſſed about with all our enemies, to witt: the diuells and our ſinnes. O how ſhall the wicked be confounded at that howre, and how fowly ſhall they ſee them ſelues beguiled! How truelie maye euerie one of them ſaie at that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me: O miſerable wretch that I am, what other commoditie haue I now by all my pleaſures paſt, but onely that I haue prouoked at this dreadfull howre the indignation of the iudge againſt me, who muſt geue ſentence vpon me? Now my pleaſures are all ended, and gone, and there remaineth of them neither relique nor memorie to comfort me withall, no more than if they neuer had bene: yea contrariewiſe they remaine as thornes that lye prickinge all about my harte, they make my cauſe doutfull, they torment my wofull ſowle now preſently, and peraduenture ſhall torment it euerlaſtinglie for euer and euer. This is the fruit that I haue gathered of my diſſolute and wanton lyfe, and of all my carnall delightes: This is the ſettinge of my teeth on edge, that my gluttonies paſt doe cauſe me now to haue. My pleaſures and delightes haue now forſaken me: They are quite gone awaie, and will neuer retourne agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne: yea perhapps in ſteede of pleaſures that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued but a momente, there are prepared for me euerlaſtinge horrible tormentes in hell fier. Now what blindnes can be greater than this? How much better had it bene for me neuer to haue bene borne, than to haue offended him, of whoſe helpe and fauour I haue at this
<pb facs="tcp:872:213"/>preſente ſo great neide? How much better had it bene for me, that the earth had opened, and ſwalowed me vp, before I had once thought to offend him? O vnfortunat daie! O curſed howre, wherein I offended thee ô Lorde! Why did I not conſider beforehande of this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full howre? Why was I not ſooner mindfull of this terrible iudgement? How were mine eies blynded with ſo ſmalle a glimſe? Is this the waie that I tooke to be ſo certayne and ſure? Is this the ende that all the honours of the worlde come vnto? What? are all thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which I haue ſo greatlie eſtiemeed hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of ſo litle accompte at this preſente?</p>

                        <p>Vpon this daie almightie God will reduce all ſuch filthines as the wicked haue cauſed in the worlde through their wicked workes, to his firſt dewe forme, and comelines.

Now after this ſort ſhall men goe vp and downe ſore afraide, and diſmaide, their hartes failinge them, and carienge their armes a croſſe, and one of them lokinge pittie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie vpon an other.

Their cheifeſt care ſhalbe where to ſeike out ſure and ſafe places to defende them ſelues from earthquakes, and from the tempeſteous ſtormes of the aier, and from the inundations of the Sea.

If I commaunded them to ſweare, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare, to robbe, and to kill, to commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, fornication, ſimonie, and vſurie, and to denie thy holie name, all this they did willin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly, and with great facilitie. If I commaunded them to beſtowe their landes, their goodes, their lyfe, and their ſowle, for a point of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and eſtimation, which I perſwaded them in anie wiſe to mainteine, or for a falſe delighte whereunto I inuited them, they did forthwith verie willinglie hazarde all this for my ſake.

How oftentimes haſt thou come to their doores in great pouertie, nakednes, and full of ſores? And what almes haddeſt thou of them, but a waiewarde anſwere, and ſhuttin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge their doores in a great furie and anger vpon thee, they beinge then more carefull to feede

Wherefore ſeinge thou art a moſt Iuſt Iudge, and knoweſt that this is moſt certainlie true, the verie order of iuſtice requireth, that they ſhoulde be now punni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for their iniuries, and contemptes, done to ſo great a maieſtie.</p>

                        <p>This conſideration helpeth alſo to ſtirre vp a

               <p>The laſt parte is Petition,<note place="margin">Petition.</note> which is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie called praier: wherein we deſire of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God all ſuch thinges as are behouefull as well for the ſaluation of our ſelues, as of our neighboures, and of all the whole Catholike Churche.</p>
               <p>Theſe fiue partes maie be exerciſed in praier: and emonge other profites and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities that are wonte to come thereby, this is one, that theſe poyntes beinge dewlie exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed doe miniſter vnto a man great plentie of matter whereupon to meditate: ſettinge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him all theſe diuerſities of meates, that if he lyſte not to eate of one, he maye yet eate of an other: and that when he hath made an ende of meditation in one matter, he maie forthwith enter into an other, and ſo fynde va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of matter wherein to continewe his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</p>
               <p>I knowe righte well, that neither all the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe partes nor this order is alwaies neceſſarie for all perſons. Howbeit this maner maie ſerue verie well for all ſuch as are but nouices and yonge beginners in this exerciſe, that ſo they

In which courſe after that they ſhalbe once entred by folowinge this introduction, then the verie vſe and experience they ſhall haue in this exerciſe, and much more the holie Ghoſt will teache them each thinge that they haue to doe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.

For a man maye diſpoſe him ſelfe vnto prayer by callinge to minde his ſynnes, and offences, and namely ſuch ſinnes as he hath committed that preſent daie, and he maie accuſe him ſelfe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and deſire of our Lorde pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for them, according to the ſayeinge of the Wiſe man. <hi>The iuſt man at the beginninge is an accuſer of him ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This maner of Preparation ſeemeth to be as it were the pullinge of of our hoſe and ſhooes to enter into the holie lande, and as it were the waſhinge of our garmentes to goe to receiue almightie God, when he commeth to treate with men, and to teache them his holie lawe. This maner of preparation we are taught to vſe euen by nature it ſelfe. For we ſee it is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon maner, that when we goe to requeſt anie benefite of anie frende of ours whom we haue offended, we doe firſt deſire him of pardon, and forgeuenes, before we demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de any other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of him. This maie be done ſometimes with the harte onely, and ſometimes by ſayeinge the general confeſſion, <hi>Confiteor Deo, &amp;c.</hi> or the pſalme: <hi>Miſerere mei Deus:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               <p>Howbeit a man ought not to ſtaie ouer longe in this conſideration of his ſinnes, (as
<pb facs="tcp:872:296"/>ſome perſons doe, that both beginne and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de herewith, yea and paſſe all their whole lyfe therein). For albeit this conſideration of our ſynnes be alwaies good, (and at the beginnin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge very neceſſary) yet it is meete that it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with ſuch moderation, as that it occupie not that time which ſhoulde be beſtowed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout other better matters. Neither is it neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in this exerciſe for a man to conſider very particularly his ſinnes, and namely ſuch as the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce whereof maie moue him to ſome euill cogitations: But it is ſufficient to make as it were a bundell of them all, and to drowne them in the bothomles Sea of the infinite goodnes and mercie of almightie God, with good hope to receiue pardon and remedie of them from the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">we may prepare our ſelues vnto prayer by conſiderin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie and greatnes of almightie God.</note> We maie alſo prepare our ſelues vnto prayer, by conſideringe the maieſtie and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of that Lorde vnto whom we goe to ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke in praier.

               <p>This conſideration of the maieſtie and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of almightie God is as it were a profounde reuerence, that the ſowle maketh within it ſelfe before the throne of that ſupreme maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, at what tyme ſhe entereth into his palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to ſpeake with him.<note place="margin">

With this ſpirite and humble reuerence a man maie repete thoſe wordes of the holie Patriarke, where he ſaithe: <hi>I will ſpeake to my Lorde, althoughe I be but duſte, and aſhes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But aboue all this, it ſhall helpe vs verie much in this preparation to conſider well what we goe about to doe, when we ſettle our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to prayer.

<pb facs="tcp:872:297"/>the ende of their longe and deuoute praiers. Now this beinge ſo, thou mayſt perceiue he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby, with how great humilitie, and reuerence, and with how great attention, and deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thou oughteſt to come, when thou doeſt open the mouthe of thy ſowle to receiue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God.

               </p>
               <p>It is thought alſo to be a good maner of preparation to ſaie ſome vocalle praiers befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re meditation: of which ſorte there be manie in diuers bookes of deuotion, and namely in the meditations of S. Auguſtine, and in the Pſalter of Dauid, where there be ſome verie deuout Pſalmes that will helpe very much to enkendle and ſtirre vp deuotion. For it is the propertie of deuoute ſentences (beinge ſaiede with an earneſt minde and attention) to woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de the harte, and to lifte it vp vnto almightie God: the which deuour ſentences are ſo much the more behouefull and neceſſarie for vs, by how much we finde our ſpirite to be more col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, and diſtracted.<note place="margin">The ſayin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of</note>

               <p>And theſe ſame prayers doe ſerue much better for this purpoſe when they be in mitre,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:872:298"/>as are manie Hymnes of the Sainctes,<note place="margin">Hymnes, proſes, and verſicles, doe ſtirre deuotion.</note> and the Proſes, and Verſicles. Forſomuche as (I kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we not how it is, that) the wordes of God vſed in this kinde of ſtile, and harmonie, doe bringe with them a greater ſweetenes, and delighte to our ſowles. And therefore we finde in the workes of S. Bonauenture (who was a verie deuout holie man) manie of theſe Hymnes. The like we finde in the workes of S. Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, and in diuers and ſundrie other of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie fathers. Likewiſe there is great commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion geuen by manie learned men (and ſurely not without good cauſe) to thoſe three diuout himnes that Ieronimo de Vida made to the three perſons in Trinitie, which beinge learned by harte, and ſaiede deuoutly, be as it were a moſt ſweite Manna to ſweiten the taſt of our ſowle at the beginninge of prayer, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe it to take a delighte in ſpirituall and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine matters.</p>
               <p>Here I thinke it neceſſarie to declare with what intention a man ought to come vnto prayer.<note place="margin">With what intention a man ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te to come vnto prayer.</note> For he muſt not goe thereunto chei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly for his owne conſolation, and delighte, (as ſome that be great louers of them ſelues vſe to doe,) but onely to fulfill herein the will of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, and to deſire of him his grace, and to diſpoſe him ſelfe for the obteyninge of the ſame. And herewith he muſt ſubmitte him ſelfe in ſuch wiſe into the handes of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, that he muſt be as readie and contente to be without conſolations in his
<pb facs="tcp:872:299"/>prayer as to haue them, remittinge himſelfe humbly into his handes, to diſpoſe of him, and of all thinges belonginge vnto him, as he ſhall thinke good, acknowledginge on the one ſide, that he deſerueth not anie thinge of him, and beleeuinge on the other, that althou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe it be ſo in verie deede, yet our Lorde of his infinite goodnes and mercie will doe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhall be moſt conuenient and behoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for his ſaluation. And therefore a man ought to contente him ſelfe a-like, whether the conſolations be great, or litle, and to take in good parte whatſoeuer vſage our Lorde ſhall ſhewe vnto him, accountinge him ſelfe vtterlie vnworthie of all thoſe thinges that he beſtoweth vpon him, and beinge readie to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill all ſuch thinges as he ſhall commaunde him, not in reſpecte of the benefites that he hopeth to receyue, but in reſpecte of them that he hath alreadie receyued, and in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his bounden duetie vnto almightie God. But we ſee that manie perſones doe quite contrarie to this rule, and be like herein vnto yonge ſhrewde boies who vnleſſe they be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deled, and cooxed, will not doe the thinge that they are commaunded.</p>
               <p>I thinke it alſo requiſite here to aduertiſe, that when a man mindeth to vſe the exerciſe of praier in the morninge,<note place="margin">we muſt be carefull ouer nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of the meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we intende to make the nexte morninge.

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:872:299"/>with a godly carefulnes preuente and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende ouer nighte vnto our Lorde that thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge which he intendeth to meditate the nexte daie followinge. And in the morninge ſo ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne as he awaketh, he ought forthwith to occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie his harte with this holie thought, before anie other doe enter therein. For at that time the diſpoſition of our harte is ſuch, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thoughte doth firſt enter into vs, it ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſethe and taketh poſſeſſion of our harte in ſuch wiſe, that we ſhall verie hardly afterwardes put it awaie from vs.</p>
               <p>And forſomuch as the praier of manie perſons is very acceptable vnto our Lorde,<note place="margin">It is good to thinke when we praye how manie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute Chriſtians are at that time pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge alſo vnto God with vs.</note> the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore thou ſhalt doe well to conſider in thy prayer both in the morninge, and euenin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, what a nomber of Gods ſeruantes both me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and women as well in monaſteries as without be at that time watchinge and perſeueringe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the preſence of almightie God, ſheedin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge many deuoute teares, yea and perhappes alſo diſciplininge and whippinge them ſelues, and ſheedinge great abundance of bloud for the loue of God: with which perſones thou oughteſt humbly to ioyne thy ſelfe, that the preſence and ſweete remembrance of them maie be vnto thee a prouocation of deuotion, and an example of perſeuerance in thy praier, and alſo that whenſoeuer thou ſhalt finde thy ſelfe colde and negligent in this exerciſe of prayer, and that ſome thoughtes come into thy minde mouinge thee to ende the ſame,

                  <p>Theſe vertues be a comelie compoſition of the inwarde and outwarde man: diſcretion, and attention in all ſuch thinges as we ſhall either doe, or ſaie, that euerie thinge maie be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted accordinge to the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and order of reaſon: and withall to brydle our tonge, and to take a dewe accompte of it: and to vſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and auſterite in the gouernment of our perſon.

For it is manifeſt that the ſomme of all Chriſtian

And this kinde of warre none other ſhal euer make, but he that hath for the loue of God atteyned to haue a true and holie abhorringe and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre of him ſelfe.

                  <p>After theſe doe followe other fowre vertues: which are the beginninge and ende of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: to witt: a moſt firme faith of ſuch thinges, as almightie God ſaith, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: and an aſſured hope in him, as in our tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we and louinge father in all the neceſſities and tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that ſhall happen vnto vs: a loue of almightie God, which muſt alwaies burne in our hartes: and iointly with this loue, to haue a feare and reuerence of his great maieſtie, and iuſtice, which muſt euermore accompanie all our workes.</p>
                  <p>And with all theſe vertues aboue named, we muſt ioyne perſeuerance and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance in the exerciſe of all theſe vertues, the which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a man in a ſmalle time to attaine to the toppe of perfection. In theſe foreſaid vertues doth the ſomme of all perfection principally conſiſt: and therefore all our ſtudie, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, muſt be emploied, in ſeekinge them by all meanes poſſible, and eſpetially by praier, which is the principall meane, whereby all goodnes is obtayned.</p>
                  <p>Here I thinke good to geue this aduiſe, that when a man ſhall demaunde of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God any of theſe vertues, he ſtaie him ſelfe therein for a time, and make as it were a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in euerie one of them, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideringe brei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly the principall motiues that maie moſt
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:872:306"/>induce vs to the loue and exerciſe of ſuch a vertue. As for example.<note place="margin">How to deſier of God the vertue of Charitie.</note> When we ſhall deſire of almightie God the vertue of charitie, which is the loue of God, we maie ſaie in this wiſe: Graunt me grace ô Lorde I beſeech thee, that I maie loue thee with all my harte, and with all my ſowle, for that thou arte an infinite goodnes, and excellencie, that deſerueth to be loued with infinite loue: and beſides this, for that thou arte my onely benefactor, my father, my creator, my laſt ende, and the ſpouſe of my ſowle, vnto whom all loue is due. In like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner when thou ſhalt deſire the vertue of hope, thou mayſt ſaie in this wiſe:<note place="margin">How to deſier the vertue of Hope.</note> Geue me grace alſo ô Lorde I beſeech thee, that in all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities and tribulations that ſhall happen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me in this lyfe, I maie truſt in thee, ſeinge thy mercie is infinite, and thy promiſes true, and the merites of thy onely begotten ſonne be of infinite value, which doe ſpeake and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke interceſſion for me. After this ſorte mayſt thou deſire the feare of God, and humilitie, with other vertues. The forme of which peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I thinke not meete to note here particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in writinge. For like as it is ſaied, that that meate doth more profite the ſicke man, which he him ſelfe eateth and cheweth with his teeth, than that which is geuen vnto him in drincke: euen ſo is that prayer wonte to be more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, which is framed by him that praieth with ſuch wordes as the holie Ghoſt teacheth him, than that praier which is made and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb facs="tcp:872:307"/>with other folkes wordes, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes be ſayed and paſſed verie lightly ouer, without anie maner of attention, or affection.</p>
                  <p>This laſt parte which is petition (beſides that it is verie eaſie to be done) is alſo very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. For (as we ſaied before) it is not onely an exerciſe of praier, but alſo of all vertues, and as it were a readinge and conference of them all: wherein a man reneweth all his good purpoſes, and deſires, and recordeth in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie the principall pointes and articles of the lawe of God, which is the continuall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the iuſt man:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2.</note> of whom it is ſaide, that he meditateth vpon the lawe of our Lorde both daie, and nighte.</p>
                  <p>Theſe fiue partes aforeſaid maie be vſed in the exerciſe of praier: albeit (as we haue ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de) they be not all neceſſarie to be vſed at all times. For ſome times all the time of prayer is ſpente in meditation alone, or in petition. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe I thought good to ſpecifie here all theſe partes of prayer, that no man might lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue of this holie exerciſe for wante of matter, and alſo that at ſuch time as deuotion fayleth, (which is no iuſt cauſe why we ſhoulde relent and withdrawe our ſelues from good exerciſes) a man might haue matter whereupon to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie him ſelfe duringe that time, doinge on his parte ſomuch as lieth in him, which is the thinge that almightie God requireth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallie of vs.</p>
                  <p>Here is diligentlie to be noted, that emonge
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:872:307"/>all theſe fiue partes of prayer, the beſt is, when the ſowle talketh with almightie God, as it doth in petition. For in readinge, or meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dinge diſcourſeth with litle labour whereſoeuer it thinketh good. But when we talke vnto almightie God, then the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge mounteth vp on highe, and after it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth alſo the will, and then hath a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly on his parte greater deuotion, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and greater feare, and reuerence of the maieſtie of almightie God, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, and withall an humble, and feruent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the thinge which he demaundeth of him. And this mouinge, and liftinge vp of the ſpirite, with all theſe actes of vertues accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panienge it, doe leaue the ſowle in a more noble ſtate, and better edified, than anie other diſcource whatſoeuer it be, as euerie man maie perceyue by experience in him ſelfe. For it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that in the diſcource of meditation there is none other thinge but onely a godly inquiſition and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of ſpirituall thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the which as it is an acte of the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge, ſo is it of litle profite, or commoditie: but in the deuour praier there is made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence and generall aſſemblie in a maner of all vertues, and with there winges the ſowle lifteth it ſelfe vp on high, and attayneth to be ioyned and vnited with almightie God.</p>
                  <p>And althoughe this ſpirituall communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conference with almightie God be the beſt poynte of all the exerciſes of prayer,
<pb facs="tcp:872:308"/>yet emonge all the communications with him, the beſt and moſt profitable is the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of loue, at ſuch time as we be actually louinge of almightie God, and praiſinge him, and deſiringe him with great inſtancie, and moſt earneſt deſires, to graunt vs that we maye loue him. For ſithence Charitie is the greateſt of all vertues, there is nothinge more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto almightie God, nor more pleaſant and profitable to a man, than the vſe, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and exerciſe of this ſo excellent a vertue.</p>
                  <p>This the holie fathers doe calle the exerciſe of aſpiringe vnto the loue of God. And to this ende were meditation, and praier, and all other good exerciſes ordeyned. And therefore it is geuen for a generall rule vnto all ſuch as doe praie, that they labour and endeuour ſo much as lyeth in them, to lifte vp their ſpirite vnto this diuine communication, which is to ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke and treate with almightie God him ſelfe, and eſpetiallie concerninge his loue, and the exerciſes of aſpiringe vnto him. And for this cauſe it ſhall doe well, to leaue this petition of the loue of God vntill the ende of all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of prayer, and ſo to reſerue the beſt wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne for the ende of this bankette, to the intent that when a man is come to the ende of his iourney, he maie ſtaie him ſelfe herein ſo lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge as he liſteth. Howbeit it ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe both to beginne and ende with this petition of the loue of God, whenſoeuer the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:872:308"/>holie Ghoſt ſhall open him a waye, and direct him vnto the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, I thinke it meete here to geue this aduertiſement, that in all ſuch thinges as we ſhall demaunde, we doe alledge alwaies in our behalfe the merites of Ieſus Chriſt our onelie and trewe Sauiour: who (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaiethe) <hi>Is our iuſtice, wiſedome, ſanctification, and redemption.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</note> Vpon his merites we ought principally to ſtaie our confidence. And his merites we ought to preſent before the diuine maieſtie, reckeninge them, and offeringe them one by one vnto the heauenly father, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge (as S.

                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.31.</note> Wherefore <hi>If God be for vs, who ſhalbe againſt vs?</hi> If God iuſtifie vs, who ſhall condemne vs?<note place="margin">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſeconde aduiſe is, that he labour to eſche we in this exerciſe the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous ſpeculation of the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge, and endeuour to vſe this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rather with affections, and feelinges of the will, than with diſcources, and ſpeculations of the vnderſtandinge.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore to be noted, that the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge on the one ſide helpeth, and on the other ſide it maie hinder the operation of the will: to witt, the loue, and feelinge of diuine thinges. For as it is neceſſarie that the vnderſtandinge doe goe before the will to gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de it, and geue it knowledge what it ought to loue: ſo when the ſpeculation of the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge is ouermuch, then it hindereth this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the will: forſomuch as it ſuffereth it not to haue place and time to worke. And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore like as it is ſaied of the poiſon which is put into treacle, that if it be litle it is holſome, and neceſſarie, but if it be ouermuch it is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: euen ſo likewiſe maie we ſaie after a ſorte in this exerciſe, that the ſeekinge to knowe God with ſimplicitie helpeth the will the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to loue him, but the ſeekinge to knowe him with ouermuch ſpeculation hindereth the will, and cauſeth the operation thereof for that time to be the more feeble, and weake. And the reaſon hereof is, for that the vertue a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d power of our ſowle beinge finite and ſtreyted within certaine boundes, and limittes, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re it employeth her vertue and force on the
<pb facs="tcp:872:311"/>one parte, the leſſe remaineth to be employed on the other: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine that ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth throughe two pypes, the more water that it diſchargeth by the one pype, the leſſe it hath to yeilde throughe the other. And after the like ſorte doth the ſowle principallie by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vnderſtandinge, by the which (for that it is ſo noble and ſo excellent a power) the ſowle employeth and powreth out all her whole force in ſuch wiſe, that in a maner ſhe worketh nothinge at all by her other powers, at ſuch tyme as the vnderſtandinge is verie at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente, and earneſtlie occupied in the vehement ſpeculation of anie matter. And therefore we finde by experience, that a man maie with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re facilitie preſerue the affection of deuotion in anie exerciſe of the bodie wherein he labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethe with his handes, than when he hath his vnderſtandinge buſely occupied and attente in the ſpeculation of anie matter. For the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandinge, and the will, be as it were two ballances of our ſowle, the which are diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in ſuch ſorte, that the aſcendinge of the one is the deſcendinge of the other, and ſo contrariewiſe. So that if the ſpeculation doe increaſe ouermuch, then the affection thereby decreaſeth: and if contrary wiſe the affection doe increaſe, then the ſpeculation forthwith decreaſeth. And this is the cauſe why the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarke Iacob was made lame of one of his fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te at what time he receyued benediction:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.</note> for whereas our ſowle hath two feete wherewith

And ſo it is ſeene by experience, that in caſe at ſuch tyme as the ſowle is enioyenge of almightie God, it doe but turne a-ſide to ſeke to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande or ſearche ſome poynte or matter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayninge vnto God, it loſeth forthwith at the verie ſame inſtante the deuotion which it had, and that ſouereine good thinge vaniſheth then awaie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, which before he enioyed. And therefore not without good cauſe doth the bridegrome aduiſe the ſpowſe in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, ſayeinge: <hi>Turne awaie thyne eies from me,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">we muſt not medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate vpon diuine mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries in ſuch wife as if we ſtudied to preache them.</note> Whereby it appeareth, that thoſe men take not the righte trade herein, that in prayer doe meditate in ſuch wiſe vpon diuine miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as if they ſhoulde ſtudie to preach them:
<pb facs="tcp:872:312"/>the which diſorderlie maner is rather to cauſe the Spirite to wander more abrode, than to recollecte it: and rather to goe out of him ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, than to kepe within himſelfe. And hereof it commeth, that when they haue made an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of theire exerciſe of praier, they remayne as drie, and without anie ioyce of deuotion, and as eaſely moued to followe euerie kinde of lightnes, and vanitie of the worlde, as they were before their exerciſe. For (to ſpeake the verie trueth) they haue not praied, but rather talked and ſtudied, which is a thinge farre dife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te from praier.

And thou muſt make accompte that in this exerciſe thou goeſt in a chariot drawen with two horſes, whereof the one is verie

                  <p>And if thou deſire to haue an other more liuely example, make accompte that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandinge muſt behaue it ſelfe towardes the will, as the nource doth towardes the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de which ſhe nourceth, who after that ſhe hath chewed the meate, ſhe then putteth it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the childes mouthe, that the childe maie taſte and feede thereupon. For otherwiſe if the nource ſhoulde both chewe the meate, and alſo eate it vp her ſelfe, leauinge the childe without anie meate, it is certaine that ſhe ſhoulde doe great iniurie to the childe, in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feringe it to die for honger, by eatinge vp that meare which was geuen vnto her for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.<note place="margin">The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge is as it were a nource to feede the will in the exerciſe of prayer.</note> Now in this wiſe muſt the vnderſtandinge behaue it ſelfe towardes the will in the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of prayer: for it appertaineth to the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge to chewe the ſpiritual matters, as the nource cheweth meate for the childe, but the vnderſtandinge muſt not retayne the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall matters for it ſelfe alone, but after that it hath once chewed them, it muſt offer them to the will, to the intent that the will maie ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte and feede thereupon, and be the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kendeled and confirmed in vertue, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, with the taſt and feelinge of thoſe ſpiritual matters.</p>

                  <p>Now if thou deſire to knowe how thou ſhouldeſt behaue thy ſelfe herein, emonge ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other waies that maie ſerue in this caſe, thou mayſt vſe this: In euerie good thinge that thou ſhalt thinke vpon either in praier, or out of praier, be carefull to goe out of hande the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewith vnto almighie God, as the yonge chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de doth, who with euerie thinge that he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth goeth out of hande to his mother, and tattelleth with her of it. And ſo in like maner when in thy prayer or at other times thou fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt anie ſpirituall iuell, thou muſt lifte vp thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne harte to almightie God, eyther to loue him, or to adore him, or to reuerence him, or to praiſe him for the ſame, accordinge as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter requireth: and thereby alſo to take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to humble thy ſelfe before him, and to deſire of him his grace. It ſhalbe a great helpe alſo hereunto to haue the ſpirite of true humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, which cauſeth a man to appeare before almightie God very poore, and naked, and to proſtrate himſelfe before that moſt highe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne maieſtie, and to be more carefull to deſire him of his mercie for the curinge of the great miſeries which he knoweth in him ſelfe, than to ſearche the profoundnes of his highe miſteries to vnderſtande them.

Wherefore ye muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande, that the deuotion which we ſeeke to obteine, is not a thinge that maie be gotten with force of armes, (as ſome perſones thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,) who laye on great lode of enforced ſighin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and ſobbinges, imagininge thereby to procure teares, and compaſſion, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke vpon the paſſion of our Sauiour.

And therefore if our Lorde ſhall ſend vs teares or other the like feelinges in our prayer, we ought humbly to accept them, and to geue him thanckes for them. But for a man to wringe them out as it were with force of armes, it is no wiſedome.

And when he hath thus done, let him not vexe nor trouble him ſelfe anie further, thoughe our Lorde ſende him not teares, and compunction of harte.</p>
                  <p>And he that can not thus doe, but ſhall perceyue him ſelfe to be ouermuch troubled in his exerciſe, let him not ſtriue to paſſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, but let him humble him ſelfe before almightie God with inwarde quietnes, and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite, and deſire him of his grace, that he maie be able to proceid in his prayer and meditation without ſuch great trouble and daunger vnto him.

                  <p>And for this cauſe we muſt take diligent heede, that if at anie time there doe ariſe in the ſowle verie feruent motions of ſenſible deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or exceſſiue ſobbinges, and ſighinges, we ſuffer not our ſelues to be caried awaie with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but we muſt temper them with great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and diſſemble them as much as we can, and withall endeuour to kepe and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newe that conſideration and thoughte within vs, which cauſed thoſe feruent motions: I mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne hereby, that we muſt remoue awaie from vs thoſe ſtormes and alterations of the fleaſhe: to wit, theſe veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſobbinges, and ſighinges, and enioye in our ſowle with quietnes the light, and deuotion, which almightie God hath then ſent vnto vs. And after this ſorte we ſhall continewe in our exerciſe a longer time, and our conſolation ſhall take deeper roote inwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly in our ſowles, and ſhall not geue any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde ſhewe thereof with weepinge, ſobbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, and other externall ſignes, which can har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlie be auoyded without great paine, in caſe a man doe once accuſtome him ſelfe verie much vnto ſuch ſenſible motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and feruours, which

                  <p>True it is, that at the firſt beginninge of nouices in ſpirituall exerciſes ſuch feruours can verie hardlie be eſchewed. For then the great wonder that a man hath of the newnes and profoundnes of diuine thinges, maketh him to enter into ſo great an admiration, and aſtoniſhmente, that he can not refraine him ſelfe from this feruencie. But after that with the vſe of dailie meditation of diuine thinges the newnes of them ceaſeth, then is his harte quieted: and although he loue almightie God with greater vehemencie, yet hath he not ſuch ſenſible feruour and diſquietnes in his loue. And ſo we ſee, that the newe wyne, and the potte of water when it beginneth firſt to trye the vnwonted heat of the fier, it boyleth ſo forceablie, that it bubbleth vp, and runneth ouer the brimme: but after that it hath boyled a certaine ſpace, it ſeetheth then much better, and is much hoatter, and yet with leſſe noyce and vehemencie.

So that like as we vſe commonlie to ſaie vnto him that rydeth vpon a kickinge flinginge horſe, that he muſt take good heede how he holdeth the reines of his bridle, and kepe a meane therein
<pb facs="tcp:872:317"/>that is, he muſt holde them neither to harde, nor to ſlacke, that the horſe neither turne bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewarde, nor runne to headlonge forwarde:<note place="margin">Out atten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion muſt proceed with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and not with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. <hi>Prou.</hi> 30.33.</note> euen ſo muſt we endeuour that our attention maye proceede in our prayers with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not with violence, and with a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate carefulnes, and diligence, and not with exceſſiue labour and traueill. Of both theſe poyntes we be aduertiſed in the holie Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. For of the one Salomon ſaiethe: Who ſo ſquiſeth ouermuch the pappes to get out milke, ſhall wringe out bloude. And of the other poynte the Prophete Eſaie ſaieth:<note place="margin">

                  <p>Howbeit in caſe we feyle of the meane, and doe leane vnto anie of theſe two extremeties,<note place="margin">Of the two extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties it is leſſe hurt to haue ouermuch attention in our prayers, than no ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re or regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of our attention therein,</note> it is leſſe hurte to leane vnto ouermuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, than vnto careleſnes and neglectinge of our attention. For a man is prouoked to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>releſnes and negligence by his owne corrupte a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d euill inclined nature: but he is not ſo prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vnto atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion. And therefore like as a how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe that is builte vpon the ſyde of a hill ſhoulde not loſe muche in the buyldinge, if at ſuche tyme as it can not be builte by line and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell iuſt vprighte, the buyldinge thereof doe more bende rather vpwarde, than downewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de: euen ſo ſhall not our attention take anie preiudice, if at what tyme it cannot continewe in our prayers in ſuch a mediocritie as we

                  <p>This aduiſe is of ſo great importance, that for want hereof we haue ſeene that certaine perſons haue paſſed ouer manie yeares with takinge litle profite by their prayers, for that they haue bene careleſſe, dull, and as it were neither hoate nor colde therein. And others contrariwiſe haue fallen into great ſickenes, and haue hurte their heades with ouermuch heate, and vehemencie, which they haue vſed in their meditations. But eſpetiallie we muſt be well warie, that at the beginninge of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation we doe not trouble and weary our head with ouermuch attention.

The li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke ought all ſpirituall perſones to doe when they receyue anie viſitations from our Lorde in their praier, and meditation: and their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence ſhoulde be ſo much the greater, by how much this exerciſe of meditation is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and this diuine blaſt more neceſſarie for praier, than that for nauigation.</p>

                  <p>Theſe be the principall aduiſes, that are to be obſerued in the exerciſe of meditation, and in euerie of the other partes that doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie the ſame, in caſe we minde fullie to accompliſhe this buſines, and not to leaue it in the midde waie.

Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore it is to be noted, that the paines which our Sauiour ſuffered in his bitter paſſion, were (as the holie fathers ſaie) the greateſt that euer were ſuffered,<note place="margin">Summa S.

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> The firſt cauſe was, the paſſinge greatnes of his charitie, which made him deſirous to redeeme mankinde moſt abundantly, and to ſatisfie moſt perfectly for the iniuries, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, committed againſt the diuine maieſtie.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:872:325"/>And becauſe the greater paines he ſhoulde ſuffer, the more perfectly he ſhoulde accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhe both the one, and the other, (and he wanted not the forces of grace to beare as great a burthen as he woulde) therefore he woulde that his paines ſhoulde be paſſinge great, that ſo likewiſe the ſatisfaction which he ſhoulde make for our dette, and the worke of our redemption might be alſo paſſinge great.</p>
                  <p>The ſeconde cauſe (which followeth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> was, that he ſuffered his payes without anie maner of eaſe, or conſolation. For (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to the reaſon before mentioned) he ſhutte vp from him ſelfe all the gates, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by anie maner of conſolation might come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, either from heauen, or from earthe: inſomuche that he was contente to be forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken not onely of his diſciples, and freindes, but alſo of his owne father, yea, and of him ſelfe alſo: to the intent that ſo beinge deſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of all companie, he might be burninge in the furnace of his moſt grieuous paines, and tormentes, without all maner of refreſſhinge of anie eaſe, or conſolation whatſoeuer, that by anie meanes might come vnto him.

<pb facs="tcp:872:326"/>of waters, and of myre, and I finde no place where to ſtaie my feete. This is that forſakin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, which our Sauiour ſignified vpon the croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, when he ſaiede:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 27.46.</note>

                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.1.</note> For at that time his holie huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie was forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the middeſt of the furious ſtreame of his paines, and tormentes, and was left deſtitute of all thinges that might either withſtande, or mitigate the force and veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                        <hi>Leuit.</hi> 16.</note> This was figured in the lawe, by thoſe two beaſtes, that were offered for the ſinnes of the people, of the which the one was killed, and offered vp in ſacrifice, and the other departed awaye, and was ſent into the wildernes, leauinge her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion alone in the tormentes. The like was done in this heauenlie ſacrifice, where God and man was offered for the ſinnes of the worlde, and the one of the two natures, to witt, the humanitie, was ſacrificed, and did ſuffer: but the other nature, to witt, the diuinitie, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted awaye, leauinge her ſiſter and companion all alone to ſuffer the tormentes. For albeit that (as concerninge the bonde of vnion) the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne nature neuer forſooke the humane nature which it had once taken, yet as touchinge the conſolation and eaſe of the paines, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, (in the inferior parte) it did wholy forſake the ſame. And therefore we ſee, that the Martirs when they went to ſuffer death, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed them ſelues verie courageous, mearie, and ioyefull, (as we reade of S. Agnes, S. Agatha,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:872:326"/>S.

                  <p>The therde cauſe of his ſo grieuous paynes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> was the tendernes of his complexion. For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas his holie bodie was formed miraculouſly by the holie Ghoſt, and the thinges that are done by miracle be more perfecte than thoſe that be done by nature,<note place="margin">S.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexioned, and moſt tender of all bodies that euer were, or ſhalbe: inſomuch as a holie father ſaiethe: <hi>That if there had bene no externall violence done vnto our Sauiours bodie, it woulde haue endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a verie great nomber of yeares, by reaſon of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and tendernes of the compoſition thereof.</hi>

                  <p>And not onely the compoſition of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but alſo the matter thereof was very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: forſomuch as the matter of it was wholly

                  <p>The fourthe cauſe of his ſo greiuouſe pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, was the very kinde of death which he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, with all the circumſtances that happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in all the continuance of his paſſion: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as each one of them (if they be well conſidered) was a kinde of martirdome by it ſelfe.

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> The firſt was, the agonie in the garden, and that wonderfull bloudie ſweate, which tric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled drowne througheout all the partes of his bodie vnto the earthe, which was the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we and moſt ſtraungeſt thinge of all that euer hath happened in the worlde.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> The ſeconde was, to be ſolde for ſo baſe a price of his owne Apoſtle, and diſciple, vnto ſo cruell enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> The therde was, to be ſo often times caried throughe the common ſtreetes bounde, and manicled, as if he had bene a verie theyfe.</p>
                  <p>The fourthe was, the puniſhement with
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:872:327"/>whippinge, and ſcourginge, which beſides that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IIII"/> the laſhes were verie crewellie laid on him, and verie manie in nomber, it is not a puniſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a man of any credite, or honeſtie, but for bondeſlaues, vagabondes, and men of moſt vyle and baſe condition.</p>
                  <p>The fifte was, that moſt cruell inuention of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> the crowne of thornes, wherein were ioyned together both moſt greiuous ſhame, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonour, and withall moſt greiuous paine, and tormente.</p>
                  <p>The ſixte was, thoſe ſo manifolde blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> and ſundrie kindes of moſt villeynous mockeries, iniuries, and reproches, which were ioyned with the tormentes: as to ſpette ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times in his face, as though he had bene a blaſphemer: to geue him buffettes, and blowes, as if he had bene a vagabonde: to apparell him ſome times in white garmentes, and ſome ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes in redde, as if he had bene a foole: to hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winke his eies, and to ieſte at him, ſayeinge, <hi>Areede, who hath ſmitten thee,</hi>

Inſomuch as that Lorde by whom all thinges were created, and in whom all thinges doe liue, and are preſerued, was accompted more vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and more vnwourthy to lyue, than Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabas an infamous malefactour.</p>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> The ninthe was, the very martirdome of the croſſe: which is a moſt cruell kinde of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for it is not a ſpeydie kinde of deathe, (as to be hanged, or beheadded) but very lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, and lingeringe: and the woundes be in the moſt ſenſible partes of the bodie: to witt, in the feete, and handes, which are moſt full of
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:872:328"/>vaines, and ſinowes, which be the iuſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of feelinge. Moreouer, his paines were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed with the poyze and weight of his owne bodie, which alwaies tended and ſwayed doun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde: and ſo it euer rented, and enlarged his woundes, and augmented the greife of his tormentes continually: and this cauſed his martirdome to become ſo extremely greiuous, that althoughe he had no deadlie wounde, yet by reaſon of the paſſinge greatnes of his paines, his moſt holie ſowle departed out of his moſt precious bodie.</p>
                  <p>The tenthe was, that whereas our Sauiour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> was thus tormented vpon the croſſe, and there became a verie Sea of paines, and tormentes, yea, whereas he was in ſuch a dolefull caſe, that if we ſhoulde ſee a verie dogge in the ſtreete ſo pittiefullie tormented it were able to brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke our hartes, yet all this notwithſtandinge his cruell enemies were ſo farre of from takin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge anie pittie or compaſſion vpon him, that euen at that verie time, they mocked, and ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed at him, and wagged their heades, ſayeinge: <hi>Fye on thee, that deſtroieſt the temple of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>and within three daies buildeſt it againe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The eleuenthe was, to haue his moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> mother preſent before his eies at all theſe martirdomes, knowinge ſo well as he did, what a paſſinge great greife it was vnto her moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent harte.</p>
                  <p>The twelfthe was ſuch a crueltie, as the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> was neuer ſeene: to witt, that whereas his
<pb facs="tcp:872:329"/>moſt holie bodie was all voide of bloude, and all the fountains of his veines emptied, and his bowels dried vp, by reaſon of the great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of bloude which he had ſhead, when he requeſted a litle water, they did not onely not graunt it vnto him, but in ſteede thereof they gaue him to drincke Eaſell, and Galle.</p>
                  <p>Now what thinge coulde be more cruellie done than this? True it is, that that riche co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous man,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luc.</hi> 16.</note> which was tormented in hell had a droppe of water denied him when he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, but yet he had no galle geuen vnto him. But here they doe not onelie denie the ſonne of almightie God the thinge that he deſired, but beſides that they increaſe his moſt grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſe paines with an other newe kinde of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente.</p>
                  <p>Euerie one of theſe pointes beinge conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſeuerally by it ſelfe, will miniſter ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient matter of verie great greife and ſorowe to anie good Chriſtian harte. And therefore whoſoeuer is deſirous to haue an earneſt and inwarde compaſſion of the paines of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, let him goe throughe euerie one of them, and make a ſtation at eche of them: and (be he neuer ſo harde harted) it is not almoſt poſſible, but that in ſome one or other of them he ſhall ſinde verie vehement motions to prouoke him vnto greife, and compaſſion.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, the paines of our Sauiour Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte are not thus ended: there be yet others without all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon farre greater than theſe,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:872:329"/>to witt, the paines of his bleſſed ſowle. For all theſe paines aboue-named, doe for the moſt parte appertaine to the paines of the croſſe, wherein his bodie ſuffered outwardly: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this viſible Croſſe,<note place="margin">The inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble croſſe of our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewith his ſowle was torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted.</note> there was yet an other inuiſible croſſe, wherein his moſt holie ſowle was crucified within his bodie, hauinge alſo foure armes, and foure nailes, (which were fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re dolorous conſiderations) and theſe were a farre greater tormente vnto him, than theve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie outwarde croſſe. For firſt of all, there were repreſented vnto him al the ſinnes of the worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> that were preſent, paſt, and to come, (for all which he ſuffered) and that ſo diſtinctlie, as if they had bene the ſinnes but of one man alone. Now to him that bare ſuch a paſſinge great loue, and zeale, vnto the honour of his father, what an vnſpekeable greife was it, to beholde ſuch an infinite nomber of abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and offences, committed againſt ſo highe a maieſtie? For it is certaine, that the ſinnes of one man alone were able to tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te him more, than al the torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of the croſſe. The which beinge ſo, what a paſſinge greate greife woulde the ſinnes of all men, and of all worldes cauſe vnto him? Suerly, there is no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandinge able to comprehende the paſſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge greatnes of this greife.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there was alſo repreſented vnto him the ingratitude and damnation of many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> men, and eſpetially of many wicked Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which woulde neuer acknowledge this ſinguler
<pb facs="tcp:872:330"/>benefite, nor endeuour to profite and helpe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues with this ſo great and ſo coſtlye a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, as he there prepared for them. This was alſo a farre greater tormente vnto him, than the tormente of the croſſe. For it is a greater paine vnto a labourer to be denied his daie wages, and the fruite of his labour, than the very labour it ſelfe, albeit it were verie great. And for this cauſe our Sauiour complained by his Prophete Eſaie of this iniurie vnto his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſayeinge: <hi>I ſaiede: In vaine haue I trauailed: In vaine,</hi>

                     <hi>conſider what cruell tormentes I ſuffer for thy ſake.

And although the paine which I ſuffer out wardly be ſo paſsinge great yet is the paine farre greater which I ſuffer in wardly, when I ſee thee ſo ingratefull and vnkinde to wardes me for the ſame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In like maner there was repreſented vnto him the horrible ſinne of that miſerable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iewrie, and the terrible puniſhement that was prepared for them within a ſhorte time after, which vndoutedlie was a greater greife, and tormente vnto him, than the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:872:330"/>cuppe of his bitter paſſion. For if the Prophete Ieremie ſignified, that the ſinne which the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes committed in goinge about to kille him, greiued him much more than his owne very deathe, what a greife woulde it be to our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, who had without all compariſon farre greater charitie, and grace, than the Prophete Ieremie?</p>
                  <p>There were moreouer repreſented vnto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IIII"/> him the greifes, and dolefull ſworde of ſoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we, which pearſed the harte of his bleſſed mother,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Now theſe fowre conſiderations and grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes, were as it were fowre armes of an other inwarde croſſe, wherewith his bleſſed ſowle was likewiſe crucified within his holie bodic. So that our ſauiour ſuffered that daie the paines and tormentes of two croſſes, th'one viſible, and tho'other inuiſible. Vpon th'one croſſe his bodie ſuffered outwardly, and vpon th'other his ſowle ſuffered much more inwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly. Now how paſſinge great the greife was, which proceided of theſe foure conſiderations, there is no vnderſtandinge able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende it: and yet we maie coniecture ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what thereof, by that outwarde ſhewe of his
<pb facs="tcp:872:331"/>blouddie ſweate in the garden.</p>
                  <p>Whoſoeuer then ſhall attentiuelie conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all theſe cauſes, ſhall clearlie ſee how paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge great the paines and tormentes of our Sauiour were, which is the intente of this firſt maner of meditatinge vpon his moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſſion. Howbeit this muſt not be the finall ende of this exerciſe, but rather it muſt be vſed as a meane to come to other endes: to witt, to vnderſtande hereby what a paſsinge great loue he bare vnto thee, that woulde ſuffer ſo much for thee: and what a great benefite he did vnto thee, in byeinge thee with ſo deare a price: and how much thou art bounde to doe for him, who hath done, and ſuffered ſo much for thee: and aboue all this, how greatlie thou oughteſt to abhorre thy ſinnes, and be greiued with them, ſith they were the cauſe of his ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge and painfull mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirdome. Nowe for theſe foure endes, (whereof we will intreat in the chapters followinge) ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth this maner of contemplation. Whereby it appeareth, that this firſt maner of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge (by waie of takinge compaſsion of the bitter paines of our Sauiour) is as it were a meane, or a ladder, vnto all the others. And for this verie cauſe S.

                  </head>
                  <p>THE ſeconde point that we haue to conſider in the paſsion of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, is the greiouſnes of our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whereby to moue our hartes to be ſorowfull for them, and to abhorre them. Wherefore we muſt vnderſtande, that (as all the holie learned fathers doe affirme) our ſinnes were the very cauſe why the ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of almightie God ſuffered ſuch greiuous paines, tormentes, and crewell death, as he ſuffered in this worlde. For it is certaine, that if there had bene no ſinne to be the meane and occaſion of his ſufferinge, it had not bene neidfull for him to haue ſuffered as he did. It
<pb facs="tcp:872:332"/>is not agreed emonge the learned diuines, whether the ſonne of God ſhoulde haue bene incarnate,<note place="margin">

If man had not ſinned, Chriſte had not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red anie paines, or deathe.</note> in caſe man had not ſinned, (for ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me doe affirme it, and ſome doe denie it,) but this is holden for a moſt certaine treuthe, that in caſe man had not ſinned, the ſonne of God ſhoulde not haue died. Whereby it appeareth, that our ſinnes were the verie cauſe that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him to ſuffer all theſe miſeries, and that our ſinnes were they that threwe him into this priſon, and that our ſinnes were they that nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him vpon the croſſe.</p>
                  <p>And thinke not, becauſe they were not thy ſinnes alone which were the cauſe hereof, that thou art therefore worthy of the leſſe puniſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente: for accordinge to the lawes of iuſtice, he deſerueth no leſſe puniſhemente that kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth an innocente beinge accompanied with manie in committinge the facte, than if he alone had killed him. So that by this rule thou feeſt, what great reaſon thou haſt to moue thee to abhorre thy ſinnes, and to be earneſtly ſorie for them, by callinge to minde that they were the tormentours which in verie deede crucified the ſonne of almightie God, and cauſed him to ſuffer ſo great paines, and tormentes. This is a greater cauſe to moue a man to abhorre ſinne, and to be ſorie for the ſame, than all other loſſes and miſeries that enſewe of ſinne, yea althoughe we ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de recken emonge our loſſes the depriuation of the euerlaſtinge glorie and felicitie which
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:872:332"/>is loſt by a deadlie ſinne, and the euerlaſtinge horrible paynes which be purchaſed by the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Now acordinge vnto this doctrine, when thou ſhalt be occupied in meditatinge vpon the holie paſsion, and ſhalt ſee how the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies doe apprehende our Sauiour, and how they accuſe him, and buffette him, and how they ſpette vpon him, and whippe him, &amp;c. thinke for certaine, that thou art in verie dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de in companie with them, and that thou haſt ioyned with them in this conſpiracie againſt our Sauiour. So that thou mayſt treulie ſaie, that thy ſinnes doe accuſe him, that thy diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute behaueour bindeth him, that thy anger and mallice whippeth him, that thy preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and raſhenes buffeteth him, that thy pride crowneth him with thornes, that thy fonde braueries and vanities doe clothe him with purple, that thy pleaſures, and delightes geue him to drincke galle, and vineger, and to be ſhorte, that thy diſobedience nayleth his handes and feete vpon the croſſe. Forſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the paines which thou deſerueſt by theſe thy ſinnes, he vowchſaffed of his infinite charitie to ſuffer for thee. For it is certaine, that the tormentors ſhoulde neuer haue had power to tormente him as they did, in caſe thy ſinnes had not geuen them force and ſtrengthe to doe the ſame.</p>
                  <p>This is one verie profitable waie of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge vpon the holie paſsion for all kinde of

Secondlie, what meane he vſed in geuinge it vnto vs. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> therdlie, with what paſsinge great loue he gaue it vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>How paſsinge great that is, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour hath beſtowed vpon vs by this benefite of our redemption, there is no tonge able to expreſſe. Howbeit we maie conceiue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> thereof by two waies. The firſt waye, is by conſideringe all the euills and miſeries whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reinto mankinde incurred throughe the ſinne
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:872:333"/>of the firſt man Adam: for all theſe miſeries were ſufficientlie remedied by our Sauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte, who beſtowed vpon vs all ſuch benefites as were contrary vnto theſe miſeries: forſomuch as it is euident, that he was geuen vnto vs to be a vniuerſall reparer of all the euilles and miſeries of the worlde. Now he that were able to recken how manie the miſeries are, whereinto the worlde hath fallen by the ſinne of the firſt man Adam, might alſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande, how many the benefites are, that came vnto vs by the ſeconde Adam, (to witt, by our Sauiour Chriſte,) which benefites be vndoutedlie innumerable.</p>
                  <p>The ſeconde waie, is by conſideringe not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> all the miſeries which our firſt father Adam brought vnto vs, but all the benefites which came vnto vs by our Sauiour Chriſte: Forſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we are made partakers of all thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefittes, by meanes of communicatinge his ſpirite vnto vs: For all ſuch as are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the ſpirite of Chriſte, are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers alſo of the vertues and merites of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte. Wherefore the Apoſtle ſaithe,<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:872:334"/>before him. And therefore for good cauſe dothe Eccleſiaſticus alledge this wonderfull title of the ſonne of God in his praier:<note place="margin">

What dignitie, what glorie can be greater than this? Now accordin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge hereunto, he that coulde recken how many the vertues, and merites of our Sauiour Chriſte haue bene, might likewiſe vnderſtande how manie the benefites haue bene that are come vnto vs by him: Forſomuch as we are made partakers of them all by the meane of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, by him is geuen vnto vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of our ſinnes, grace, glorie, libertie, peace, ſaluation, redemption, ſanctification, iuſtice, ſatisfaction, ſacramentes, merites, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and all other thinges, which he had, and were behouefull for our ſaluation. And by reaſon of this his ſo bountiefull communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge, he is called in the holie Scriptures, the father, the bridegroome, and the vniuerſall head of the Catholike Churche: becauſe whatſoeuer the father hath, appertaineth to his children, and whatſoeuer the bridegrome hath, he imparteth to his ſpowſe, and whatſoeuer the head hath, the members are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the benefites which our Sauiour Chriſte hath beſtowed vpon vs. But by what meane hath he geuen them vnto vs? It is
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:872:334"/>euident that by the meane of his holie incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and paſſion, whereby he made him ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe partaker of all our debtes, and miſeries: and ſo by takinge vpon him all our miſeries, he made vs partakers of all his benefites. This ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge vpon him all our miſeries is vndoutedlie a farre greater thinge, than to make vs parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of al his benefites. For certainlie it is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re wonderfull thinge in God to ſuffer miſeries, than to beſtowe benefites: becauſe as there is nothinge more propre and conuenient to his infinite goodnes, than to beſtowe benefites, ſo is there nothinge more ſtraunge and further of from that infinite felicitie, than to ſuffer miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Whereby it appeareth, that we are much more bounde vnto him for the paines and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes whiche he hath ſuffered for vs, than for the great benefites which he hath geuen vnto vs: I meane hereby, that we are much more bounde vnto him for the maner whereby he hath remedied our miſeries, than for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie remedie it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>But how paſſinge great was the loue whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewith our Sauiour beſtowed all this vpon vs? This is without all compariſon farre greater,<note place="margin">with what a paſſinge great loue our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for vs.</note> than all the reſt. For certainlie the deſire which our Sauiour had to ſuffer paines for vs, was far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re greater, than the verie paines which he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and much more paines woulde he haue ſuffered, if it had bene needfull for vs. Three howres he continued ſufferinge paines and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes vpon the croſſe for our ſinnes: But
<pb facs="tcp:872:335"/>what is this in compariſon of that, which the greatnes of his charitie coulde haue vouchſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to doe for vs? Verelie if it had bene neid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for vs, that he ſhoulde there haue ſuffered paynes and tormentes vntill the daie of iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemente, the loue was ſo paſſinge great which he bare vnto vs, that he woulde vndoubtedlie haue done it. So that albeit he ſuffered much for vs, yet was the loue which he bare vnto vs farre greater, than the paines which he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for vs. And therefore if we be greatlie bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>This is ſo copious and ſo plentifull a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to meditate vpon, that certainly if a man ſhoulde continewe thinkinge vpon it vntill the ende of the worlde he ſhoulde alwaies finde newe reaſons of the conueniencie of this holie miſterie, and newe cauſes to induce him to lifte vp his ſpirite more and more in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the high wiſedome and prouidence of almightie God herein. But becauſe this volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me woulde be to great in caſe I ſhoulde treate of this matter at large: I will therefore at this preſente onely ſhewe the order and fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation of this conſideration, to the intent that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout and religious ſowle maie hereby haue a waye opened vnto her to proſecute all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore it is to be noted, that if we will ſee what proportion and conueniencie a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne hath with his ende, it is neceſſarie to make a compariſon betwene the ſame meane, and the ende: and the greater helpes that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne hath towardes the atteininge of the ende,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:872:339"/>the more proper and conueniente is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne for the ſame ende. As for example: If we will examine whether a medicine be conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for a diſeaſe, we muſt conſider the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes of the diſeaſe, and the proprieties and vertues of the medicine: and when we haue ſeene what proportion there is betwene the one, and the other, we maie then iudge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the medicine be conueniente for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me diſeaſe or not. And euen in like maner is it in this caſe: for whereas it is euidente vnto vs, that the paſſion and bloud of our Sauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte is a generall medicine for all the miſeries and neceſſities of man, if we will trye the conueniencie of this medicine, we muſt make a longe compariſon betwene the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and the deſeaſe: and in caſe we be able to ſearche and examine well both th'one, and th'other, we ſhall certainlie finde, that this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine is ſo fitte and conuenient for the curin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of this diſeaſe, and of all the braunches, and accidentes of the ſame, as if the medicine had bene onelie inſtituted for the curinge of each defecte in the diſeaſe: the which vndoutedlie is a matter able to bringe a man that ſhoulde conſider of it attentiuely into a great aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhement, and admiration. If thou be not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie perſwaded herein, tell me then I praie thee, what ſatisfaction coulde be offered more ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciente for payment of the common debtes of mankinde, than the moſt pretious bloude
<pb facs="tcp:872:340"/>which the ſonne of almightie God ſhead for vs vpon the Croſſe? To cure alſo the woundes of our pride, couetouſenes, ingratitude, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, delightes, and the loue of our ſelues, with all other euils which proceed thereof, what thinge coulde be more conuenient, than God vpon a croſſe? Likewiſe to geue vs knowledge of the goodnes, and mercie of almightie God, to enkendle vs more in the loue of him, to ſtrengthen more our confidence, and to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke more our forgetfulnes, and vnthankefulnes, what thinge coulde be more conuenient, than God vpon a croſſe? Moreouer to enriche a man with merites, to exalte him vnto greater honour, to enkendle his ſpirite in deuotion, to comforte him in his tribulations, to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coure him in his temptations, to helpe him in his labours, to encourage him vnto great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, and finally to geue a perfecte exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all vertues, what thinge coulde be more conueniente, than Ieſus Chriſte vpon the croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe? And to comprehende all in one worde, if the Euangelicall lyfe be well conſidered, it is nothinge els, but onely a continuall croſſe: and ſo conſequentlie, what thinge coulde be more conueniente to direct a kinde of lyfe which is altogether a croſſe, than an other croſſe?</p>
                  <p>And if thou be yet deſirous to vnderſtande this conueniencie more euidentlie, conſider attentiuelie what thinge a Chriſtian lyfe is, (for
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:872:340"/>the leadinge of a Chriſtian lyfe is the ende of all the traueills and paines of our Sauiour Chriſte,<note place="margin">Note well this poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te.</note>) and the ſame conſideration will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare verie plainlie vnto thee, what conuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie there is betwene this meane, and this ende. A Chriſtian lyfe (takinge it in his full perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) is not ſuch a kinde of lyfe as the Chriſtians vſe to liue at this daie in the worlde:<note place="margin">what a Chriſtian lyfe is.</note> but ſuch a lyfe as our Sauiour Chriſte liued, and ſuch a lyfe as his diſciples liued, whoſe paines, labours, and miſeries were ſo great, that one of them ſaieth thus of them:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9.</note> We are become a ſpectacle vnto God, vnto Angels, and vnto men. For truelie ſo great are our paines, and miſeries, and in ſuch wiſe are we reuyled and perſecuted of the worlde, that (as though we were wilde beaſtes baited at a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke) we are ſpetially looked vpon, not onely of men, and of Angels, but alſo of almightie God him ſelfe. And afterwardes he ſaiethe thus: Vntil this preſente houre we doe ſuſteine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, thirſte, nakednes, and blowes, and haue not ſomuch as a denne wherein to hyde our ſelues. We goe from place to place, and we gaine the bread that we eate with our owne handes. They curſe vs, and we bleſſe them: They perſecute vs, and we ſuffer them: They blaſpheme vs, and we praie for them: To conclude, in ſuch wiſe are we turmoyled and contemned of the worlde, as if we were the very duſt, and dirte, that they tread vndernethe
<pb facs="tcp:872:341"/>their feete: And as thoughe we were moſt wicked, and abhominable men, the worlde is fullie perſuaded, that nothinge can be more acceptable vnto almightie God, than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our deathe, and condemnation.</p>
                  <p>This is (my dear brother) a Chriſtian lyfe. This verie Chriſtian lyfe did the Prophetes liue, and ſo did alſo the Martirs, the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſors, and thoſe bleſſed holie Mounkes that liued in the primitiue Church in the wildernes. To be ſhorte, this Chriſtian lyfe did all the Saintes liue. And this Chriſtian lyfe the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth verie plainlie in his Epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes in theſe wordes:<note place="margin">Heb. <hi>11.</hi>
                     </note> The ſaintes were moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſcourged, apprehended, impriſoned, ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſawed in peices, tempted, and put to death with the ſworde: They went in this worlde apparailed in ſheepes and goates ſkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, very poore, needie, and afflicted, of whom the worlde was not worthie: They liued in wildernes, and in ſolitarie places, aparte from the companie of men, and had none other habitation, but the dennes and cliftes of the earthe. This is indeede the perfection of the Chriſtian lyfe, which the goſpell teacheth vs, and which our Sauiour Chriſte came to bringe into the worlde. This Chriſtian lyfe if it be well conſidered is a continuall croſſe, and death of the whole man, to the intent that after he is thus mortified a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d annihilated he maie be able, and deſpoſed to be transformed into God. For
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:872:341"/>like as there can not be generation without corruption, (forſomuch as that thinge which is muſt periſhe, to the ende that that maye be made which is not,) euen ſo this ſpirituall rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and transformation of man into God can not be made, vnleſſe the olde man doe firſt die, that ſo by death and corruption of the olde man he maie be transformed into God. Whereupon it plainlie enſeweth, that all the Euangelicall lyfe is nothinge els (as we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue ſaiede) but death, and a croſſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore what thinge can be more conuenient to directe ſuch a kinde of lyfe as is altogether a continuall croſſe, than an other croſſe? And if there be nothinge more apte and conueniente to ingender a fier, than an other fier, and if eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thinge be moſt apte to ingender a thinge like vnto it ſelfe, what thinge can be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable and conueniente to ingender a croſſe, than an other croſſe? Vndoubtedly ſo it is: and therefore there is nothinge of greater force to encourage and ſtrengthen at this daye all holie Catholike men, and women, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer paines, vniuſtice, wronges, pouertie, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, diſcipline, honger, thirſte, colde, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, and to be ſhorte, all the troubles, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, afflictions, perſecutions, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, tormentes, and miſeries of this worlde, and all the auſterite of the Euangelicall lyfe, than to fixe their eies vpon the croſſe. Our of this ſchoole of the croſſe came the Martirs. In
<pb facs="tcp:872:342"/>this ſchoole learned alſo the Apoſtles. And this ſchoole hath likewiſe taughte and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened the virgins, the Confeſſors, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie mounkes, and to conclude, all the Sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes, to liue a holie auſtere kinde of lyfe. And it was the croſſe that hath accompanied and comforted them in all their labours, trowbles, paynes, afflictions, and perſecutions.</p>
                  <p>Now when the deuout ſowle findeth ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kindes of fruites in this tree of lyfe for all times, and for all neceſſities, ſhe can not but wonder at the highe wiſedome of that ſouerai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne maſter, that hath founde out ſuch an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lente meane for our remedie: and ſhe is alſo prouoked thereby to acknowledge the vnſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keable goodnes of ſo mercifull a father, who beinge able to haue holpen and remedied man with his onely will, choſe rather to put him ſelfe to ſo great paines, and diſhonours, to the intente that man might be more honored and more holpen by this meane, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by anie other.</p>

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:872:342"/>will open vnto vs the waie, and eſpeciallie the grace of the holie Ghoſt, who is the principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le teacher of theſe exerciſes.
